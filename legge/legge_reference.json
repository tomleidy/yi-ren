		"footnote": "The Text under each hexagram consists of one paragraph by king W\u01cen, explaining the figure as a whole, and of six (in the case of hexagrams 1 and 2, of seven) paragraphs by the duke of K\u00e2u, explaining the individual lines. The explanatory notices introduced above to this effect will not be repeated. A double space will be used to mark off the portion of king W\u01cen from that of his son.\nEach hexagram consists of two of the trigrams of F\u00fb-hs\u00ee, the lower being called \u2018the inner,\u2019 and the one above \u2018the outer.\u2019 The lines, however, are numbered from one to six, commencing with the lowest. \u2018To denote the number of it and of the sixth line, the terms for \u2018commencing\u2019 and \u2018topmost\u2019 are used. The intermediate lines are simply \u2018second,\u2019 \u2018third, &c. As the lines must be either whole or divided, technically called strong and weak, yang and yin, this distinction is indicated by the application to them of the numbers nine and six. All whole lines are nine, all divided lines, six.\nTwo explanations have been proposed of this application of these numbers. The Khien trigram, it is said, contains 3 strokes (\u2630), and the Khwian 6 (\u2637). But the yang contains the yin in itself, and its representative number will be 3+6=9, while the yin, not containing the yang, will only have its own number or 6. This explanation, entirely arbitrary, is now deservedly abandoned. The other is based on the use of the \u2018four Hsiang,\u2019 or emblematic figures (\u268c the great or old yang, \u268d the young yang, \u268f the old yin, and \u268e the young yin). To these are assigned (by what process is unimportant for our present purpose) the numbers 9, 8, 7, 6. They were \u2018the old yang, represented by 9, and \u2018the old yin,\u2019 represented by 6, that, in the manipulation of the stalks to form new diagrams, determined the changes of figure; and so 9 and 6 came to be used as the names of a yang line and a yin line respectively. This explanation is now universally acquiesced in. The nomenclature of first nine, nine two, &c., or first six, six two, &c., however, is merely a jargon; and I have preferred to use, instead of it, in the translation, in order: to describe the lines, the names \u2018undivided\u2019 and \u2018divided.\u2019\nI. Does king W\u01cen ascribe four attributes here to Khien, or only two? According to Appendix IV, always by Chinese writers assigned to Confucius, he assigns four, corresponding to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and knowledge in man\u2019s nature. K\u00fb Hs\u00ee held that he assigned only two, and that we should translate, \u2018greatly penetrating,' and \u2018requires to be correct and firm,\u2019 two responses in divination. Up and down throughout the Text of the 64 hexagrams, we often find the characters thus coupled together. Both interpretations are possible. I have followed what is accepted as the view of Confucius. It would take pages to give a tithe of what has been written in justification of it, and to reconcile it with the other.\n\u2018The dragon\u2019 is the symbol employed by the duke of K\u00e2u to represent \u2018the superior man\u2019 and especially \u2018the great man,\u2019 exhibiting the virtues or attributes characteristic of heaven. The creature\u2019s proper home is 1n the water, but it can disport itself on the land, and also fly and soar aloft. It has been from the earliest time the emblem with the Chinese of the highest dignity and wisdom, of sovereignty and sagehood, the combination of which constitutes \u2018the great man.\u2019 One emblem runs through the lines of many of the hexagrams as here.\nBut the dragon appears in the sixth line as going beyond the proper limits. The ruling-sage has gone through all the sphere in which he is called on to display his attributes; it is time for him to relax. The line should not be always pulled tight; the bow should not be always kept drawn. The unchanging use of force will give occasion for repentance. The moral meaning found in the hme is that \u2018the high shall be abased.\u2019\nThe meaning given to the supernumerary paragraph is the opposite of that of paragraph 6. The \u2018host of dragons without their heads\u2019 would give us the next hexagram, or Khw\u01cen, made up of six divided lines. Force would have given place to submission, and haughtiness to humility; and the result would be good fortune. Such at least is the interpretation of the paragraph given in a narrative of the Zo-Kwan under B.C. 513. For further explanation of the duke of K\u00e2u's meaning, see Appendixes II and IV."

When the superior man (here intended) has to make any movement, if he take the initiative, he will go astray; if he follow, he will find his (proper) lord.

		"footnote": "II. The same attributes are here ascribed to Khw\u01cen, as in the former hexagram to Khien;\u2014but with a difference. The figure, made up of six divided lines, expresses the ideal of subordination and docility. The superior man, represented by it, must not take the initiative, and by following he will find his lord,\u2014the subject, that is of Khien. Again, the correctness and firmness is defined to be that of \u2018a mare, \u2018docile and strong,\u2019 but a creature for the service of man. That it is not the sex of the animal which the writer has chiefly in mind is plain from the immediate mention of the superior man, and his lord.\nThat superior man will seek to bring his friends along with himself to serve his ruler. But according to the arrangement of the trigrams by king W\u00e2n, the place of Khw\u01cen is in the south-west, while the opposite quarter is occupied by the yang trigram K\u01cen, as in Figure 2, Plate III. All that this portion of the Thwan says is an instruction to the subject of the hexagram to seek for others of the same principles and tendencies with himself to serve their common lord. But in quietness and firmness will be his strength.\nThe symbolism of the lines is various. Paragraph 2 presents to us the earth itself, according to the Chinese conception of it, as a great cube. \u2018To keep his excellence under restraint, as in paragraph 3, is the part of a minister or officer, seeking not his own glory, but that of his ruler. Paragraph 4 shows its subject exercising a still greater restraint on himself than in paragraph 3. There is an interpretation of the symbolism of paragraph 5 in a narrative of the 30 Kwan, under the 12th year of duke Kh\u00e2o, B.c. 530. \u2018Yellow\u2019 is one of the five \u2018correct\u2019 colours, and the colour of the earth. \u2018The lower garment\u2019 is a symbol of humility. The fifth line is the seat of honour. If its occupant possess the\nqualities indicated, he will be greatly fortunate.\nSee the note on the sixth line of hexagram 1. What is there said to be \u2018beyond the proper limits\u2019 takes place here \u2018in the wild.\u2019 The humble subject of the divided line is transformed into a dragon, and fights with the true dragon, the subject of the undivided line. They fight and bleed, and their blood is of the colour proper to heaven or the sky, and the colour proper to the earth. Paragraph 7 supposes that the hexagram Khw\u01cen should become changed into Khien;\u2014the result of which would be good."

		"footnote": "The character called Kun is pictorial, and was intended to show us how a plant struggles with difficulty out of the earth, rising gradually above the surface. This difficulty, marking the first stages in the growth of a plant, is used to symbolise the struggles that mark the rise of a state out of a condition of disorder, consequent on a great revolution. The same thing is denoted by the combination of the trigrams that form the figure; --as will be seen in the notes on it under Appendix II.\nI have introduced within parentheses, in the translation, the words \u2018in the case which the hexagram presupposes.\u2019 It is necessary to introduce them. King W\u01cen and his son wrote, as they did in every hexagram, with reference to a particular state of affairs which they had in mind. This was the unspoken text which controlled and directed all their writing; and the student must try to get hold of this, if he would make his way with comfort and success through the Yi. W\u01cen saw the social and political world around him in great disorder, hard to be remedied. But he had faith in himself and the destinies of his House. Let there be prudence and caution, with unswerving adherence to the right; let the government of the different states be entrusted to good and able men: --then all would be well.\nThe first line is undivided, showing the strength of its subject. He will be capable of action, and his place in the trigram of mobility will the more dispose him to it. But above him is the trigram of peril; and the lowest line of that, to which especially he must look for response and co-operation, is divided and weak hence arise the ideas of difficulty in advancing, the necessity of caution, and the advantage of his being clothed with authority.\nTo the subject of the second line, divided, advance is still more difficult. He is weak in himself; he is pressed by the subject of the strong line below him. But happily that subject, though strong, is correct; and above in the fifth line, in the place of authority, is the strong one, union with whom and the service of whom should be the objects pursued. All these circumstances suggested to the duke of K\u01ceu the idea of a young lady, sought in marriage by a strong wooer, when marriage was unsuitable, rejecting him, and finally, after ten years, marrying a more suitable, the only suitable, match for her.\nThe third line is divided, not central, and the number of its place is appropriate to the occupancy of a strong line. All these things should affect the symbolism of the line. But the outcome of the whole hexagram being good, the superior man sees the immediate danger and avoids it.\nThe subject of the fourth line, the first of the upper trigram, has recourse to the strong suitor of line 1, the first of the lower trigram, and with his help is able to cope with the difficulties of the position, and go forward.\nThe subject of the fifth line is in the place of authority, and should show himself a ruler, dispensing benefits on a great scale. But he is in the very centre of the trigram denoting perilousness, and line 2, which responds to 5, is weak. Hence arises the symbolism, and great things should not be attempted.\nThe sixth line is weak; the third responding to it is also weak; it is at the extremity of peril; the game is up. What can remain for its subject in such a case but terror and abject weeping?"

The object of the hexagram is to show how such a condition should be dealt with by the parent and ruler, whose authority and duty are represented by the second and sixth, the two undivided lines. All between the first and last sentences of the Thwan must be taken as an oracular response received by the party divining on the subject of enlightening the youthful ignorant. This accounts for its beg more than usually enigmatical, and for its being partly rhythmical. See Appendix I, in loc.\nThe subject of the first line, weak, and at the bottom of the figure, is in the grossest ignorance. Let him be punished. If punishment avail to loosen the shackles and manacles from the mind, well, if not, and punishment be persevered with, the effect will be bad.\nOn the subject of the second line, strong, and in the central place, devolves the task of enlightening the ignorant, and we have him discharging it with forbearance and humility.

He appears also as \u2018a son\u2019 taking the place of his father.\nThe third line is weak, and occupies an odd place belonging properly to an undivided line; nor is its place in the centre.

What good can be done with or by the subject of it?\nThe fifth line is in the place of honour, and has for its correlate the strong line in the second place. Being weak in itself, it is taken as the symbol of a simple lad, willing to be taught.\nThe topmost line is strong, and in the highest place.

In such a case, nothing but firm correctness is necessary to great success.\n\u2018Going through a great stream,\u2019 an expression frequent in the Y\u00ee, may mean undertaking hazardous enterprises, or encountering great difficulties, without any special reference; but more natural is it to understand by \u2018the great stream\u2019 the Yellow river, which the lords of K\u00e2u must cross in a revolutionary movement against the dynasty of Yin and its tyrant. The passage of it by king W\u00fb, the son of W\u01cen in B.C. 1122, was certainly one of the greatest deeds in the history of China. It was preceded also by long \u2018waiting,\u2019 till the time of assured success came.\n\u2018The border\u2019 under line 1 means the frontier territory of the state. There seems no necessity for such a symbolism. \u2018The sand\u2019 and \u2018the mud\u2019 are appropriate with reference to the watery defile; but it is different with \u2018 the border.\u2019 The subject of the line appears at work in his distant fields, not thinking of anything but his daily work; and he is advised to abide in that state and mind.\n\u2018The sand\u2019 of paragraph 2 suggests a nearer approach to the defile, but its subject is still self-restrained and waiting.

As to the nature of the reward here given, see on the L\u00ee K\u00ee, X, 11, 32.\nP. Regis explains several of the expressions in the Text, both in the Thwan and the Hsiang, from the history of king W\u01cen and his son king W\u00fb. Possibly his own circumstances may have suggested to W\u01cen some of the Thwan; and his course in avoiding a direct collision with the tyrant Sh\u00e2u, and W\u00fb\u2019s subsequent exploits may have been in the mind of the duke of K\u00e2u.

He is denominated kang z\u01cen, \u2018an old, experienced man.\u2019\n\u2018The rules,\u2019 it is said, \u2018are twofold ;\u2014first, that the war be for a righteous end; and second, that the manner of conducting it, especially at the outset, be right.\u2019 But how this and the warning in the conclusion should both follow from the divided line being in the first place, has not been sufficiently explained.\nHow line 2 comes to be the symbol of the general in command of the army has been shown above on the Thwan. The orders of the king thrice conveyed to him are to be understood of his appointment to the command, and not of any rewards conferred on him as a tribute to his merit. Nor is stress to be laid on the \u2018thrice.\u2019 \u2018It does not mean that the appointment came to him three times; but that it was to him exclusively, and with the entire confidence of the king.\u2019\nThe symbolism of line 3 is very perplexing. P. Regis translates it:\u2014'Milites videntur deponere sarcinas in curribus. Male.\u2019 Canon McClatchie has:\u2014'Third-six represents soldiers as 1t were lying dead 1n their baggage carts, and is unlucky.\u2019 To the same effect was my own translation of the paragraph, nearly thirty years ago. But the third line, divided, cannot be forced to have such an indication. \u2018The meaning I have now given is more legitimate, taken character by character, and more in harmony with the scope of the hexagram. The subject of line 2 is the one proper leader of the host. But line 3 is divided and weak, and occupies the place of a strong line, as if its subject had perversely jumped over two, and perched himself above it to take the command. This interpretation also suits better in the 5th paragraph.\nLine 4 is weak and not central; and therefore \u2018to retreat\u2019 is natural for its subject. But its place is even, and proper for a divided line; and the retreat will be right in the circumstances.\nIn line 5 we seem to have an intimation of the important truth that only defensive war, or war waged by the rightful authority to put down rebellion and lawlessness, is right. \u2018The birds in the fields\u2019 symbolise parties attacking for plunder. The fifth line symbolises the chief authority,\u2014the king, who is weak, or humble, and in the centre, and cedes the use of all his power to the general symbolised by line 2. The subject of 2 is \u2018the oldest son. Those of three and four ate supposed to be \u2018the younger brother and son,\u2019 that is, the younger men, who would cause evil if admitted to share the command.\nThe lesson on the topmost line is true and important, but the critics seem unable to deduce it from the nature of the line, as divided and in the sixth place."

The whole line occupying the fifth place, or that of authority, in the hexagram, represents the ruler to whom the subjects of all the other lines offer a ready submission. According to the general rules for the symbolism of the lines, the second line is the correlate of the fifth; but all the other lines are here made subject to that fifth ,\u2014-which is also a law of the Yf, according to the \u2018 Daily Lecture.\u2019 To me it has the suspicious look of being made for the occasion. \u2018The harmony of union, therefore, is to be secured by the sovereign authority of one; but he is warned to see to it that his virtue be what will beseem his place, and subjects are warned not to delay to submit to him.\nWhere does the \u2018sincerity\u2019 predicated of the subject of line 1 come from? The \u2018earthenware vessel\u2019 is supposed to indicate its plain, unadorned character; but there is nothing in the position and nature of the line, beyond the general idea in the figure, to suggest the attribute.\nLine 2 is the proper correlate of 5. Its position in the centre of the inner or lower trigram agrees with the movement of its subject as proceeding from the inward mind Line 3 is weak, not in the centre, nor in its correct place. The lines above and below it are both weak. All these things are supposed to account for what is said on it.\n\u2018The one beyond himself\u2019 in line 4 is the ruler or king, who is the subject of 5, and with whom union ought to be sought. The divided line, moreover, is in a place proper to it. If its subject be firm and correct, there will be good fortune.\nThe subject of line 5 is the king, who must be the centre of union. The ancient kings had their great hunting expeditions in the different seasons; and that of each season had its peculiar rules. But what is stated here was common to all. When the beating was completed, and the shooting was ready to commence, one side of the enclosure into which the game had been driven was left open and unguarded ;\u2014a proof of the royal benevolence, which did not want to make an end of all the game. So well known and understood is this benevolence of the model king of the hexagram, that all his people try to give it effect. Thus the union contemplated is shown to be characterised by mutual confidence and appreciation in virtue and benevolence.\nA weak line being in the 6th place, which is appropriate to it, its subject is supposed to be trying to promote union among and with the subjects of the lines below. It is too late. The time is past. Hence it is symbolised as \u2018 without a head,\u2019 that is, as not having taken the first step, from which its action should begin, and go on to the end."

The idea of \u2018restraint\u2019 having once been determined on as that to be conveyed by the figure, it is easily made out that the restraint must be small, for its representative is the divided line in the fourth place; and the check given by that to all the undivided lines cannot be great. Even if we suppose, as many critics do, that all the virtue of that upper trigram Sun is concentrated in its first line, the attribute ascribed to Sun is that of docile flexibility, which cannot long be successful against the strength emblemed by the lower trigram Khien. The restraint therefore is small, and in the end there will be \u2018progress and success.\u2019\nThe second sentence of the Thwan contains indications of the place, time, and personality of the writer which it seems possible to ascertain. The fief of K\u00e2u was the western portion of the kingdom of Yin or Shang, the China of the twelfth century B.c., the era of king Wan. Rain coming and moistening the ground is the cause of the beauty and luxuriance of the vegetable world, and the emblem of the blessings flowing from good training and good government. Here therefore in the west, the hereditary territory of the house of K\u00e2u, are blessings which might enrich the whole kingdom; but they are somehow restrained. The dense clouds do not empty their stores.\nP. Regis says:\u2014\u2018To declare openly that no 1ain fell from the heavens long covered with dense clouds over: the great tract of country, which stretched from the western border to the court and on to the eastern sea, was nothing else but leaving it to all thoughtful minds to draw the conclusion that the family of Wan was as worthy of the supreme seat as that of Sh\u00e2u, the tyrant, however ancient, was unworthy of it (vol. i, p. 356). The intimation is not put in the Text, however, so clearly as by P. Regis.\nLine 1 is undivided, the fist line of Khien, occupying its proper place. Its subject, therefore, notwithstanding the check of line 4, resumes his movement, and will act according to his strong nature, and go forward.\nLine 2 is also strong, and though an even place is not appropriate to it, that place being central, its subject will make common cause with the subject of line 1; and there will be good fortune.\nLine 3, though strong, and in a proper place, yet not being in the centre, is supposed to be less able to resist the restraint of line 4; and hence it has the ill omens that are given.\nThe subject of line 4, one weak line against all the strong lines of the hexagram, might well expect wounds, and feel apprehension in trying to restrain the others; but it is in its proper place; it is the first line also of Sun, whose attribute is docile flexibility. The strong lines are moved to sympathy and help, and \u2018there 19 no mistake.\u2019\nLine 5 occupies the central place of Sun, and converts, by the sincerity of its subject, 4 and 6 into its neighbours, who suffer themselves to be used by it, and effect their common object.\nIn line 6, the idea of the hexagram has run its course. The harmony of nature is restored. The rain falls, and the onward march of the strong lines should now stop. But weakness that has achieved such a result, if it plume itself on it, will be in a position of peril; and like the full moon, which must henceforth wane. Let the superior man, when he has attained his end, remain in quiet."

The character giving its name to the hexagram plays an important part also in the symbolism; and this may be the reason why it does not, as the name, occupy the first place in the Thwan. Looking at the figure, we see it is made up of the trigrams Tui, representing a marsh, and Khien, representing the sky. Tui is a yin trigram, and its top line is divided. Below Khien, the great symbol of strength, it may readily suggest the idea of treading on a tiger\u2019s tail, which was an old way of expressing what was hazardous (Sh\u00fb V, xxv, 2). But what suggests the statement that \u2018the tiger does not bite the treader?\u2019 The attribute of Tui is pleased satisfaction. Of course such an attribute could not be predicated of one who was in the fangs of a tiger. The coming scatheless out of such danger further suggests the idea of \u2018progress and success\u2019 in the course which king Wa4an had in his mind. And according to Appendix VI, that course was \u2018propriety,\u2019 the observance of all the rules of courtesy. On these, as so many stepping-stones, one may tread safely amid scenes of disorder and peril.\nLine 1 is an undivided line in an odd place; giving us the ideas of activity, firmness, and correctness. One so characterised will act rightly.\nLine 2 occupies the middle place of the trigram, which is supposed to symbolise a path cut straight and level along the hill-side, or over difficult ground. Line 5 is not a proper correlate, and hence the idea of the subject of 2 being \u2018a quiet and solitary man.\u2019\nLine 3 is neither central nor in an even place, which would be proper to it. But with the strength of will which the occupant of an odd place should possess, he goes forward with the evil results so variously emblemed. The editors of the imperial edition, in illustration of the closing sentence, refer to Analects VII, x.\nLine 4 is in contiguity with 5, whose subject is in the place of authority; but he occupies the place proper to a weak or divided line, and hence he bethinks himself, and goes softly.\nBeneath the symbolism under line 5, lies the principle that the most excellent thing in \u2018propriety\u2019 is humility. And the subject of the line, which is strong and central, will not be lacking in this, but bear in mind that the higher he is exalted, the greater may be his fall.\nWhat is said on line 6 is good, but is only a truism. The whole course has been shown; if every step has been right and appropriate, the issue will be very good."

		"footnote": "XI. The language of the Thwan has reference to the form of Th\u00e2i, with the three strong lines of Khien below, and the three weak lines of Khw\u01cen above. The former are \u2018the great,\u2019 active and vigorous; the latter are \u2018the small,\u2019 inactive and submissive.\nBut where have the former \u2018come\u2019 from, and whither are the latter \u2018gone?\u2019 In many editions of the Y\u00ee beneath the hexagram of Th\u00e2i here, there appears that of Kwei Mei, the 54th in order (\u4df5), which becomes Th\u00e2i, if the third and fourth lines exchange places. But in the notes on the Thwan, in the first Appendix, on hexagram 6, I have spoken of the doctrine of \u2018changing figures, and intimated my disbelief of it. The different hexagrams arose necessarily by the continued manipulation of the undivided and divided lines, and placing them each over itself and over the other. When king W\u01cen wrote these Thwan, he was taking the 64 hexagrams, as they were ready to his hand, and not forming one from another by any process of divination. The \u2018gone\u2019 and \u2018come\u2019 are merely equivalent to \u2018below\u2019 and \u2018above,\u2019 in the lower trigram or in the upper.\nA course in which the motive forces are represented by the three strong, and the opposing by the three weak lines, must be progressive and successful. Th\u00e2i is called the hexagram of the first month of the year, the first month of the natural spring, when for six months, through the fostering sun and genial skies, the processes of growth will be going on.\nThe symbolism of paragraph I is suggested by the three strong lines of A Khien all together, and all possessed by the same instinct to advance. The movement of the first will be supported by that of the others, and be fortunate.\nThe second line is strong, but in an even place. This is supposed to temper the strength of its subject; which is expressed by the first of his characteristics. But the even place is the central; and it is responded to by a proper correlate in the fifth line above. Hence come all the symbolism of the paragraph and the auspice of good fortune implied in it.\nBeneath the symbolism in paragraph 3 there lies the persuasion of the constant change that is taking place in nature and in human affairs. As night succeeds to day, and winter to summer, so calamity may be expected to follow prosperity, and decay the flourishing of a state. The third is the last of the lines of Khien, by whose strength and activity the happy state of Th\u00e2i has been produced. Another aspect of things may be looked for; but by firmness and correctness the good estate of the present may be long continued.\nAccording to the treatise on the Thwan, the subjects of the fourth and other upper lines are not \u2018the small returning\u2019 as opponents of the strong lines below, as is generally supposed; but as the correlates of those lines, of one heart and mind with them to maintain the state of Th\u00e2i, and giving them, humbly but readily, all the help in their power.\nT\u00ee-y\u00ee, the last sovereign but one of the Yin dynasty, reigned from B.C. 1191 to 1155; but what was the history of him and his sister here referred to we do not know. P. Regis assumes that he gave his sister in marriage to the lord of K\u00e2u, known in subsequent time as king W\u01cen, and that she was the famous Th\u00e2i-sze;\u2014contrary to all the evidence I have been able to find on the subject.\nAccording to Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, T\u00ee-y\u00ee was the first to enact a law that daughters of the royal house, in marrying princes of the states, should be in subjection to them, as if they were not superior to them in rank. Here line 5, while occupying the place of dignity and authority in the hexagram, is yet a weak line in the place of a strong one; and its subject, accordingly, humbly condescends to his strong and proper correlate in line 2.\nThe course denoted by Th\u00e2i has been run; and will be followed by one of a different and unhappy character. The earth dug from the moat had been built up to form a protecting wall; but it is now again fallen into the ditch. War will only aggravate the evil; and however the ruler may address good proclamations to himself and the people of his capital, the coming evil cannot be altogether averted."

Genial influences have done their work, the processes of growth are at an end. Henceforth increasing decay must be looked for.\nNaturally we should expect the advance of the subject of the first of the three weak lines to lead to evil; but if he set himself to be firm and correct, he will bring about a different issue.\nPatience and obedience are proper for the small man in all circumstances.

But a ruler must not be without an awe-inspiring majesty.\nEven the topmost line takes its character from 5. The strength of its subject is still tempered, and Heaven gives its approval."

His humility need not keep him from asserting the right, even by force of arms.\nThe subject of the sixth line, which is weak, is outside the game, so to speak, that has been played out.

Where there are these conditions men are sure to follow; nor will they follow those in whom they have no complacency. The hexagram includes the cases where one follows others, and where others follow him; and the auspice of great progress and success is due to this flexibility and applicability of it. But in both cases the following must be guided by a reference to what is proper and correct. See the notes on the Thwan and the Great Symbolism.\nLine 1 is strong, and lord of the lower trigram. The weak lines ought to follow it; but here it is below them, in the lowest place of the figure. This gives rise to the representation of one changing his pursuit. Still through the native vigour indicated by the line being strong, and in its correct place, its subject will be fortunate. Going beyond his gate to find associates indicates his public spirit, and superiority to selfish considerations.\nLine 2 is weak. Its proper correlate is the strong 5; but it prefers to cleave to the line below, instead of waiting to follow 5. Hence the symbolism of the text, the bad omen of which needs not to be mentioned.\nLine 3 is also weak, but it follows the strong line above it and leaves line 1, reversing the course of 2;\u2014with a different issue. It is weak, however, and 4 is not its proper correlate; hence the conclusion of the paragraph is equivalent to a caution.\nLine 4 is strong, and in the place of a great minister next the ruler in 5. But his having adherents may be injurious to the supreme and sole authority of that ruler, and only a sincere loyalty will save him from error and misfortune.\nLine 5 is strong, and in its correct place, with 2 as its proper correlate; thus producing the auspicious symbolism.\nThe issue of the hexagram is seen in line 6; which represents the ideal of following, directed by the most sincere adherence to what is right.

It denotes here a state in which things ale going to ruin, as if through poison or venomous worms; and the figure is supposed to describe the arrest of the decay and the restoration to soundness and vigour, so as to justify its auspice of great progress and success. \u2018To realise such a result, however, great efforts will be required, as in crossing the great stream; and a careful consideration of the events that have brought on the state of decay, and the measures to be taken to remedy it is also necessary. See Appendix I on the \u2018three days.\u2019\nThe subject of line 1, and of all the other lines, excepting perhaps 6, appears as a son. Yet the line itself is of the yin nature, and the trigram in which it plays the principal part is also yin.\nLine 2 is strong, and of the yang nature, with the yin line 5 as its proper correlate. In line 2, 5 appears as the mother; but its subject there is again a son, and the upper trigram altogether is yang.\nI am unable to account for these things. As is said in the note of Regis on line 2 :\u2014\u2018Haec matris fillique denominatio ad has lineas mere translatitia est, et, ut ait commentarius vulgaris, ad explicationem sententiarum eas pro matre et filio supponere dicendum est. Nec ratio reddetur si quis in utroque hoc nomine mysterium quaerat. Cur enim aliis in figuris lineae nunc regem, nunc vasallum, jam imperii administrum, mox summum armorum praefectum referre dicantur? Accommodantur scilicet lineae ad verba sententiae et verba sententiae ad sensum, quemadmodum faciendum de methodis libri Shih King docet Mencius, V, i, ode 4. 2.\u2019\nWe must leave this difficulty. Line 1 is weak, and its correlate 4 is also weak. What can its subject do to remedy the state of decay? But the line is the first of the figure, and the decay is not yet great. By giving heed to the cautions in the Text, he will accomplish what is promised.\nThe ruler in line 5 is represented by a weak line, while 2 is strong. Thus the symbolism takes the form of a son dealing with the prevailing decay induced somehow by his mother. But a son must be very gentle in all his intercourse with his mother, and especially so, when constrained by a sense of duty to oppose her course. I do not think there is anything more or better to be said here. The historical interpretation adopted by Regis and his friends, that the father here is king W\u01cen, the mother Th\u00e2i-sze, and the son king W\u00fb, cannot be maintained. I have searched, but in vain, for the slightest Chinese sanction of it, and it would give to K\u00fb the meaning of misfortunes endured, instead of troubles caused.\nLine 3 is strong, and not central, so that its subject might well go to excess 1n his efforts. But this tendency is counteracted by the line\u2019s place in the trigram Sun, often denoting lowly submission.\nLine 4 is weak, and in an even place, which intensifies that weakness. Hence comes the caution against going forward.\nThe weak line 5, as has been said, is the seat of the ruler; but its proper correlate is the strong 2, the strong siding champion minister, to whom the work of the hexagram is delegated.\nLine 6 is strong, and has no proper correlate below. Hence it suggests the idea of one outside the sphere of action, and taking no part in public affairs, but occupied with the culture of himself."

That action must be governed by rectitude, however, and by caution grounded on the changing character of all conditions and events. The meaning of the concluding sentence is given in Appendix I as simply being\u2014that, \u2018the advancing power will decay in no long time.\u2019 L\u00fb K\u01cen-kh\u00ee (Ming dynasty) says:\u2014\u2018The sun (or the day) is the symbol of what is Yang; and the moon is the symbol of what is Yin. Eight is the number of the second of the four emblematic figures (the smaller Yin), and seven is the number of the third of them (the smaller Yang). Hence to indicate the period of the coming of what is Yin, we use the phrase, \u2018\u2018the eighth month;\u201d and to indicate the period of the coming of what is Yang, we use the phrase, \u2018\u2018the seventh day.\u201d\u201d The Khang-hs\u00ee editors say that this is the best explanation of the language of the Text that can be given: \u2014\u2018The Yang numbers culminate in 9, the influence then receding and producing the 8 of the smaller Yin. The Yin numbers culminate in 6, and the next advance produces the 7 of the smaller Yang; so that 7 and 8 are the numbers indicating the first birth of what is Yin and what is Yang\u2019 \u2018If we go to seek,\u2019 they add, \u2018any other explanation of the phraseology of the Text, and such expressions as \u201c3 days,\u201d \u201c3 years,\u201d \u201c10 years,\u201d &c., we make them unintelligible.\u2019 Lin is the hexagram of the twelfth month.\nLine 1 is a strong line in its proper place. The danger is that its subject may be more strong than prudent, hence the caution in requiring firm correctness.\nLine 2, as strong, should be in an odd place; but this is more than counterbalanced by the central position, and its correlate in line 5.\nLine 3 is weak, and neither central, nor in its correct position. Hence its action will not be advantageous; but being at the top of the trigram Tui, which means being pleased, its subject is represented as \u2018well pleased to advance.\u2019 Anxious reflection will save him from error.\nLine 4, though weak, is in its proper place, and has for its correlate the strong 1. Hence its advance is \u2018in the highest style.\u2019\nLine 5 is the position of the ruler. It is weak, but being central, and having for its correlate the strong and central 2, we have in it a symbol of authority distrustful of itself, and employing fit agents;\u2014characteristic of the wise ruler.\nLine 6 is the last of the trigram Khw\u01cen, the height therefore of docility. Line 2 is not its correlate, but it belongs to the Yin to seek for the Yang; and it is so emphatically in this case. Hence the characteristic and issue as assigned."

Remove the obstacles to union, and high and low will come together with a good understanding. And how are those obstacles to be removed? By force, emblemed by the gnawing; that is, by legal constraints. And these are sure to be successful. The auspice of the figure is favourable. There will be success.\nLines 1 and 6 are much out of the game or action described in the figure. Hence they are held to represent parties receiving punishment, while the other lines represent parties inflicting it. The punishment in line 1 is that of the stocks, administered for a small offence, and before crime has made much way. But if the \u2018depriving\u2018 of the toes is not merely keeping them in restraint, but cutting them off, as the Chinese character suggests, the punishment appears to a western reader too severe.\nLine 2 is weak, appropriately therefore in an even place, and it is central besides. The action therefore of its subject should be effective; and this is shown by the \u2018biting through the soft flesh, an easy thing. Immediately below, however, is a strong offender represented by the strong line, and before he will submit it is necessary to \u2018bite off his nose;\u2019 for punishment is the rule;\u2014it must be continued and increased till the end is secured.\nLine 3 is weak, and in an even place. The action of its subject will be ineffective; and is emblemed by the hard task of gnawing through dried flesh, and encountering, besides, what is distasteful and injurious in it. But again comes in the consideration that here punishment is the rule, and the auspice is not all bad.\nOf old, in a civil case, both parties, before they were heard, brought to the court an arrow (or a bundle of arrows), in testimony of their rectitude, after which they were heard; in a criminal case, they in the same way deposited each thirty pounds of gold. or some other metal. See the Official Book of Kau, 27. 14, 15. The subject of the fourth line\u2019s getting those pledges indicates his exercising his judicial functions; and what he gnaws through indicates their difficulty. Moreover, though the line is strong, it is in an even place; and hence comes the lesson of caution.\nThe fifth line represents \u2018the lord of judgment.\u2019 As it is a weak line, he will be disposed to leniency; and his judgments will be correct. This is declared by his finding the \u2018yellow metal;\u2019 for yellow is one of the five \u2018correct\u2019 colours. The position is in the centre and that of rule; but the line being weak, a caution is given, as under the previous line.\nThe action of the figure has passed, and still we have, in the subject of line 6, one persisting in wrong, a strong criminal, wearing the cangue, and deaf to counsel.

Thus he cultivates\u2014adorns\u2014himself in his humble position; but if need be, righteousness requiring it, he can give up every luxury and indulgence.\nLine 2 is weak and in its proper place, but with no proper correlate above. The strong line 3 is similarly situated. These two lines therefore keep together, and are as the beard and the chin. Line 1 follows 2. What is substantial commands and rules what is merely ornamental.\nLine 3 is strong, and between two weak lines, which adorn it, and bestow their favours on it. But this happy condition is from the accident of place. The subject of the line must be always correct and firm to ensure its continuance.\nLine 4 has its proper correlate in 1, from whose strength it should receive ornament, but 2 and the strong 3 intervene and keep them apart, so that the ornament is only white, and of no bright colour. Line 4, however, is faithful to 1, and earnest for their union, And finally line 3 appears in a good character, and not with the purpose to injure, so that the union of 1 and 4 takes place. All this is intended to indicate how ornament recognises the superiority of solidity. Compare the symbolism of the second line of Kun (3), and that of the topmost line of Khwei (38).\nLine 5 is in the place of honour, and has no proper correlate in 2. It therefore associates with the strong 6, which is symbolised by the heights and gardens round a city, and serving both to protect and to beautify it. Thus the subject of the line receives adorning from without, and does not of itself try to manifest it. Moreover, in his weakness, his offerings of ceremony are poor and mean. But, as Confucius said, \u2018In ceremonies it is better to be sparing than extravagant\u2019 Hence that stinginess does not prevent a good auspice.\nLine 6 is at the top of the hexagram. Ornament has had its course, and here there is a return to pure, \u2018white,\u2019 simplicity. Substantiality is better than ornament. "

The figure consists of five divided lines, and one undivided, which last thus becomes the prominent and principal line in the figure. Decay or overthrow has begun at the bottom of it, and crept up to the top. The hexagram is that of the ninth month, when the beauty and glory of summer have disappeared, and the year is ready to fall into the arms of sterile winter. In the political world, small men have gradually displaced good men and great, till but one remains; and the lesson for him is to wait. The power operating against him is too strong; but the fashion of political life passes away. If he wait, a change for the better will shortly appear.\nThe lesser symbolism is chiefly that of a bed or couch with its occupant. The idea of the hexagram requires this occupant to be overthrown, or at least that an attempt be made to overthrow him.\nAccordingly the attempt in line r is made by commencing with the legs of the couch. The symbolism goes on to explain itself. The object of the evil worker is the overthrow of all firm correctness.\nOf course there will be evil.\nLine 2 is to the same effect as 1; only the foe has advanced from the legs to the frame of the couch.\nLine 3 also represents an overthrower; but it differs from the others in being the correlate of 6. The subject of it will take part with him. His association is with the subject of 6, and not, as in the other weak lines, with one of its own kind.\nFrom line 4 the danger is imminent. The couch has been overthrown. The person of the occupant is at the mercy of the destroyers.\nWith line 5 the symbolism changes. The subject of 5 is \u2018lord of all the other weak lines,\u2019 and their subjects are at his disposal.\nHe and they are represented as fishes, following one another as if strung together. All fishes come under the category of yin.\nThen the symbolism changes again. The subject of 5, representing and controlling all the yin lines, is loyal to the subject of the yang sixth line. He is the rightful sovereign in his palace, and 5 leads all the others there to enjoy the sovereign\u2019s favours.\nWe have still different symbolism under line 6. Its strong subject, notwithstanding the attempts against him, survives, and acquires fresh vigour. The people again cherish their sovereign, and the plotters have wrought to their own overthrow."

The last hexagram showed us inferior prevailing over superior men, all that is good in nature and society yielding before what is bad. But change is the law of nature and society. When decay has reached its climax, recovery will begin to take place.\nIn Po we had one strong topmost line, and five weak lines below it; here we have one strong line, and five weak lines above it. To illustrate the subject from what we see in nature,\u2014Po is the hexagram of the ninth month, in which the triumph of cold and decay in the year is nearly complete. It is complete in the tenth month, whose hexagram is Khw\u01cen \u4dc1; then follows our hexagram F\u00fb, belonging to the eleventh month, in which was the winter solstice when the sun turned back in his course, and moved with a constant regular progress towards the summer solstice. In harmony with these changes of nature are the changes in the political and social state of a nation. There is nothing in the Yi to suggest the hope of a peifect society or kingdom that cannot be moved.\nThe strong bottom line is the first of K\u01cen, the trigram of movement, and the upper trigram is Khw\u01cen, denoting docility and capacity. The strong returning line will meet with no distressing obstacle, and the weak lines will change before it into strong, and be as friends. The bright quality will be developed brighter and brighter from day to day, and month to month.\nThe sentence, \u2018In seven days comes his return,\u2019 occasions some perplexity. If the reader will 1efer to hexagrams 44, 33, 12, 20, 23, and 2, he will see that during the months denoted by those figures, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, gth, and roth, the yin lines have gradually been prevailing over the yang, until in Khw\u01cen (2) they have extruded them entirely from the lineal figure. Then comes our F\u00fb, as a seventh figure, in which the yang line begins to reassert itself, and from which it goes on to extrude the yin lines in their turn. Explained therefore of the months of the year, we have to take a day for a month. And something analogous\u2014we cannot say exactly what\u2014must have place in society and the state.\nThe concluding auspice or oracle to him who finds this Fa by divination is what we might expect.\nThe subject of line 1 is of course the undivided line, meaning here, says Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, \u2018the way of the superior man.\u2018 There must have been some deviation from that, or \u2018returning\u2019 could not be spoken of.\nLine 2 is in its proper place, and central; but it is weak. This is more than compensated for, however, by its adherence to line 1, the fifth line not being a proper correlate. Hence the return of its subject is called excellent or admirable.\nLine 3 is weak, and in the uneven place of a strong line. It is the top line, moreover, of the trigram whose attribute is movement. Hence the symbolism; but any evil issue may be prevented by a realisation of danger and by caution.\nLine 4 has its proper correlate in 1; different from all the other weak lines; and its course is different accordingly.\nLine 5 is in the central place of honour, and the middle line of Khw\u01cen, denoting docility. Hence its auspice.\nLine 6 is weak; and being at the top of the hexagram, when its action of returning is all concluded, action on the part of its subject will lead to evils such as are mentioned. \u2018Ten years\u2019 seems to be a round number, signifying a long time, as in hexagram 3. 2."

The different lines are occupied with the repression or restraint of movement. The first three lines receive that repression, the upper three exercise it. The accumulation to which all tends is that of virtue; and hence the name of T\u00e2 Kh\u00fb, \u2018the Great Accumulation.\u2019\nWhat the Thwan teaches, is that he who goes about to accumulate his virtue must be firm and correct, and may then, engaging in the public service, enjoy the king\u2019s grace, and undertake the most difficult enterprises.\nLine 1 is subject to the repression of 4, which will be increased if he try to advance. It is better for him to halt.\nLine 2 is liable to the repression of 5, and stops its advance of itself, its subject having the wisdom to do so through its position in the central place. The strap below, when attached to the axle, made the carriage stop; he himself acts that part.\nLine 3 is the last of Khien, and responds to the sixth line, the last of Kan, above. But as they are both strong, the latter does not exert its repressive force. They advance rapidly together; but the position is perilous for 3. By firmness and caution, however, its subject will escape the peril, and the issue will be good.\nThe young bull in line 4 has not yet got horns. The attaching to their rudiments the piece of wood to prevent him from goring is an instance of extraordinary precaution; and precaution is always good.\nA boar is a powerful and dangerous animal. Let him be castrated, and though his tusks remain, he cares little to use them. Here line 5 represents the ruler in the hexagram, whose work 1s to repress the advance of evil.

Not only is there no evil, but there is good fortune.\nThe work of repression is over, and the strong subject of line 6 has now the amplest scope to carry out the idea of the hexagram in the accumulation of virtue."

The auspice of the whole hexagram is good.\nThe first line is strong, and in its proper place; its subject might suffice for the nourishing of himself, like a tortoise, which is supposed to live on air, without more solid nourishment. But he is drawn out of himself by desire for the weak 4, his proper correlate, at whom he looks till his jaw hangs down, or, as we say, his mouth waters. Hence the auspice is bad.

It becomes symbolic of danger, and what the authors of the Text had in mind was to show how danger should be encountered, its effect on the mind, and how to get out of it.\nThe trigram exhibits a strong central line, between two divided lines. The central represented to king W\u01cen the sincere honesty and goodness of the subject of the hexagram, whose mind was sharpened and made penetrating by contact with danger, and who acted in a manner worthy of his character.

If we take the whole figure as expressing the subject, we have, as in the treatise on the T hwan, \u2018a double brightness, a phrase which is understood to denominate the ruler. If we take the two central lines as indicating the subject, we have weakness, dwelling with strength above and below. In either case there are required from the subject a strict adherence to what is correct, and a docile humility. On the second member of the Thwan Kh\u00e2ng-\u017eze says:\u2014\u2018The nature of the ox is docile, and that of the cow is much more so. The subject of the hexagram adhering closely to what is correct, he must be able to act in obedience to it, as docile as a cow, and then there will be good fortune.\u2019\nLine 1 is strong, and at the bottom of the trigram for fire, the nature of which is to ascend. Its subject therefore will move upwards, and is in danger of doing so coarsely and vehemently. But the lowest line has hardly entered into the action of the figure, and this consideration operates to make him reverently careful of his movements; and there is no error.\nLine 2 is weak, and occupies the centre. Yellow is one of the five correct colours, and here symbolises the correct course to which the subject of the line adheres.\nLine 3 is at the top of the lower tngram, whose light may be considered exhausted, and suggests the symbol of the declining sun. The subject of the line should accept the position, and resign himself to the ordinary amusements which are mentioned, but he groans and mourns instead. Hus strength interferes with the lowly contentment which he should cherish,\nThe strength of line 4, and its being in an even place, make its subject appear in this unseemly manner, disastrous to himself.\nLine 5 is in the place of honour, and central. But it is weak, as is its correlate. Its position between the strong 4 and 6 fills its subject with anxiety and apprehension, that express themselves as is described. But such demonstrations are a proof of his inward adherence to right and his humility. There will be good fortune.\nLine 6, strong and at the top of the figure, has the intelligence denoted by its trigrams in the highest degree, and his own proper vigour. Through these his achievements are great, but his generous consideration is equally conspicuous, and he falls into no error."

		"footnote": "XXXI. With the 31st hexagram commences the Second Section of the Text. It is difficult to say why any division of the hexagrams should be made here, for the student tries in vain to discover any continuity in the thoughts of the author that is now broken. The First Section does not contain a class of subjects different from those which we find in the Second. That the division was made, however, at a very early time, appears from the sixth Appendix on the Sequence of the Hexagrams, where the writer sets forth an analogy between the first and second figures, representing heaven and earth, as the originators of all things, and this figure and the next, representing (each of them) husband and wife, as the originators of all the social relations. This, however, is far from carrying conviction to my mind. The division of the Text of the Yi into two sections is a fact of which I am unable to give a satisfactory account.\nHsien, as explained 1n the treatise on the Thwan, has here the meaning of mutual influence, and the duke of A4u, on the various lines, always uses Kan for it in the sense of \u2018moving\u2019 or \u2018influencing to movement or action.\u2019 This is to my mind the subject of the hexagram considered as an essay,\u2014\u2018Influence; the different ways of bringing it to bear, and their issues,\u2019\nThe Chinese character called hsien is \u54b8, the graphic symbol for \u2018all, together, jointly.\u2018 Kan, the symbol for \u2018influencing,\u2019 has hsien in it as its phonetic constituent (though the changes in pronunciation make it hard for an English reader to appreciate this), with the addition of hsin, the symbol for \u2018the heart.\u2019 Thus \u611f kan, \u2018to affect or influence,\u2019 = \u54b8 + \u5fc3: and it may have been that while the name or word was used with the significance of \u2018influencing,\u2019 the \u5fc3 was purposely dropt from it, to indicate the most important element in the thing,\u2014the absence of all purpose or motive. I venture to think that this would have been a device worthy of a diviner.\nWith regard to the idea of husband and wife being in the teaching of the hexagram, it is derived from the more recent symbolism of the eight trigrams ascribed to king W\u01cen, and exhibited on p. 33 and plate III. The more ancient usage of them is given in the paragraph on the Great Symbolism of Appendix II. The figure consists of K\u01cen (\u2636), \u2018the youngest son,\u2019 and over it Tui (\u2631), \u2018the youngest daughter.\u2019 These are in \u2018happy union.\u2019\nNo influence, it is said, is so powerful and constant as that between husband and wife; and where these are young, it is especially active. Hence it is that Hsien is made up of K\u01cen and Tui. All this is to me very doubtful. I can dimly apprehend why the whole line (\u268a) was assumed as the symbol of strength and authority, and the broken line as that of weakness and submission. Beyond this I cannot follow F\u00fb-hs\u00ee in his formation of the trigrams; and still less can I assent to the more recent symbolism of them ascribed to king W\u01cen.\nComing now to the figure, and its lines, the subject is that of mutual influence , and the author teaches that that influence, correct in itself, and for correct ends, is sure to be effective. He gives an Instance,\u2014the case of a man marrying a young lady, the regulations for which have been laid down in China from the earliest times with great strictness and particularity. Such influence will be effective and fortunate.\nLine 1 is weak, and at the bottom of the hexagram. Though 4 be a proper correlate, yet the influence indicated by it must be ineffective. However mucha man\u2019s great toes may be moved, that will not enable him to walk.\nThe calves cannot move of themselves. They follow the moving of the feet. The moving of them indicates too much anxiety to move. Line 2, moreover, is weak. But it is also the central line, and if its subject abide quiet, till he is acted on from above, there will be good fortune.\nNeither can the thighs move of themselves. The attempt to move them is inauspicious. Its subject, however, the line being strong, and in an odd place, will wish to move, and follows the subject of 4, which is understood to be the seat of the mind. He exercises his influence therefore with a mind and purpose, which 1s not good.\nLine 4 is strong, but in an even place. It is the seat of the mind.\nIts subject therefore is warned to be firm and correct in order to a good issue. If he be wavering and uncertain, his influence will not extend beyond the circle of his friends.\nThe symbolism of line 5 refers to a part of the body behind the heart, and is supposed therefore to indicate an influence, ineffective indeed, but free from selfish motive, and not needing to be repented of.\nLine 6 is weak, and in an even place. It is the topmost line also of the trigram of satisfaction. Its influence by means of speech will only be that of loquacity and flattery, the evil of which needs not to be pointed out."

H\u01ceng consists of Sun, \u2018the oldest daughter\u2019 and K\u01cen, the oldest son. The couple are more staid. The wife occupies the lower place; and the relation between them is marked by her submission. This is sound doctrine, especially from a Chinese point of view; but I doubt whether such application of his teaching was in the mind of king W\u01cen.

If both be continuously observant of what is correct, the inferior being also submissive, and the superior firm, good fortune and progress may be predicated of their course.\nLine 1 has a proper correlate in 4; but between them are two strong lines; and it is itself weak. \u2018These two conditions are against its subject receiving much help from the subject of 4.

A husband, however, and a man generally, has to assert himself, and lay down the rule of what is right.\nIn line 6 the principle of perseverance has run its course; the motive power of K\u01cen is exhausted.

No. He saw also in the figure that which suggested to him that strength should be held in subordination to the idea of right, and exerted only in harmony with it.\nThis is the lesson of the hexagram, as sententiously expressed in the Thwan.\nLine 1 is strong, in its correct place, and also the first line in Khien, the hexagram of strength, and the first line in T\u00e2 Kwang. The idea of the figure might seem to be concentrated in it; and hence we have it symbolised by \u2018strength in the toes,\u2019 or \u2018advancing.\u2019 But such a measure is too bold to be undertaken by one in the lowest place, and moreover there is no proper correlate in 4.

A small man so symbolled will use his strength to the utmost; but not so the superior man. For him the position is beyond the safe middle, and he will be cautious; and not injure himself, like the ram, by exerting his strength.\nLine 4 is still strong, but in the place of a weak line; and this gives occasion to the cautions with which the symbolism commences, The subject of the line going forward thus cautiously, his strength will produce good effects, such as are described.\nLine 5 is weak, and occupies a central place. Its subject will cease therefore to exert his strength; but this hexagram does not forbid the employment of strength, but would only control and direct it.

It is about a feudal prince whose services to the country have made him acceptable to his king. The king\u2019s favour has been shown to him by gifts and personal attentions such as form the theme of more than one ode in the Shih; see especially III, iii, 7. The symbolism of the lines dimly indicates the qualities of such a prince. \u017din means \u2018to advance.\u2019 Hexagrams 46 and 53 agree with this in being called by names that indicate progress and advance. The advance in \u017din is like that of the sun, \u2018the shining light, shining more and more to the perfect day.\u2019\nLine 1 is weak, and in the lowest place, and its correlate in 4 is neither central] nor in its correct position. This indicates the small and obstructed beginnings of his subject. But by his firm correctness he pursues the way to good fortune; and though the king does not yet believe in him, he the more pursues his noble course.\nLine 2 is weak, and its correlate in 5 is also weak. Its subject therefore has still to mourn in obscurity. But his position is central and correct, and he holds on his way, till success comes ere long. The symbolism says he receives it \u2018from his grandmother;\u2019 and readers will be startled by the extraordinary statement, as I was when I first read it. Literally the Text says \u2018the king\u2019s mother,\u2019 as P. Regis rendered it, \u2014\u2018Istam magnam felicitatem a matre regis recipit.\u2019 He also tries to give the name a historical reference;\u2014to Th\u00e2i-Kiang, the grandmother of king W\u01cen; Th\u00e2i-Z\u01cen, his mother; or to Th\u00e2i-sze, his wife, and the mother of king W\u01cen and the duke of K\u00e2u, all famous in Chinese history, and celebrated in the Shih. But \u2018king\u2019s father\u2019 and \u2018king\u2019s mother\u2019 are well-known Chinese appellations for \u2018grandfather\u2019 and \u2018grandmother. This is the view given on the passage, by Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, K\u00fb Hs\u00ee, and the Khang-hs\u00ee editors, the latter of whom, indeed, account for the use of the name, instead of \u2018deceased mother,\u2019 which we find in hexagram 62, by the regulations observed in the ancestral temple. These authorities, moreover, all agree in saying that the name points us to line 5, the correlate of 2, and \u2018the lord of the hexagram.\u2019 Now the subject of line 5 is the sovereign, who at length acknowledges the worth of the feudal lord, and gives him the great blessing. The \u2018New Digest of Comments on the Yi (1686), in its paraphrase of the line, has, \u2018He receives at last this great blessing from the mild and compliant ruler.\u2019 I am not sure that \u2018motherly king\u2019 would not be the best and fairest translation of the phrase.\nCanon McClatchie has a very astonishing note on the name, which he renders \u2018Imperial Mother\u2019 (p. 164):\u2014\u2018That is, the wife of Imperial Heaven (Juno), who occupies the \u201cthrone of the diagram,\u201d viz. the fifth stroke, which is soft and therefore feminine. She is the Great Ancestress of the human race. See Imp. Ed. vol. iv, Sect. v, p. 25, Com.\u2019 Why such additions to the written word?\nLine 3 is weak, and in an odd place; but the subjects of 1 and 2 are possessed by the same desire to advance as the subject of this. A common trust and aim possess them; and hence the not unfavourable auspice.\nLine 4 is strong, but it is in an even place, nor is it central. It suggests the idea of a marmot (? or rat), stealthily advancing. Nothing could be more opposed to the ideal of the feudal lord in the hexagram.\nIn line 5 that lord and his intelligent sovereign meet happily. He holds on his right course, indifferent as to results, but things are so ordered that he is, and will continue to be, crowned with success.\nLine 6 is strong, and suggests the idea of its subject to the last continuing his advance, and that not only with firm correctness, but with strong force. The \u2018horns\u2019 are an emblem of threatening strength, and though he uses them only in his own state, and against the rebellious there, that such a prince should have any occasion to use force is matter for regret."

The treatment of the subject shows how such an officer will conduct himself, and maintain his purpose. The symbolism of the figure is treated of in the same way in the first and second Appendixes.\nAppendix VI merely says that the advance set forth in 35 is sure to meet with wounding, and hence in is followed by Ming \u00ce.\nLine 1 is strong, and in its right place;\u2014its subject should be going forward. But the general signification of the hexagram supposes him to be wounded. The wound, however, being received at the very commencement of its action, is but slight. And hence comes the emblem of a bird hurt so as to be obliged to droop its wings. The subject then appears directly as \u2018the superior man.\u2019 He sees it to be his course to desist from the struggle for a time, and is so rapt in the thought that he can fast for three days and not think of it, When he does withdraw, opposition follows him; but it is implied that he holds on to his own good purpose.\nLine 2 is weak, but also in its right place, and central; giving us the idea of an officer, obedient to duty and the right. His wound in the left thigh may impede his movements, but does not disable him. He finds means to save himself, and maintains his good purpose.\nLine 3, strong and in a strong place, is the topmost line of the lower trigram. It responds also to line 6, in which the idea of the sovereign, emblemed by the upper trigram, is concentrated.\nThe lower trigram is the emblem of light or brightness, the idea of which again is expressed by the south, to which we turn when we look at the sun in its meridian height. Hence the subject of the line becomes a hunter pursuing his game, and successfully. The good officer will be successful in his struggle; but let him not be Over eager to put all things right at once.\nLine 4 is weak, but in its right place. A@ Hof says he does not understand the symbolism, as given in the Text. The translation indicates the view of it commonly accepted. The subject of the line evidently escapes from his position of danger with little damage.\nLine 5 should be the place of the ruler or sovereign in the hexagram; but 6 is assigned as that place in Ming \u00ce. The officer occupying 5, the centre of the upper trigram, and near to the sovereign, has his ideal in the count of A$, whose action appears in the Shf, III, pp. 123, 127, 128. He is a historical personage.\nLine 6 sets forth the fate of the ruler, who opposes himself to the officer who would do him good and intelligent service. Instead of becoming as the sun, enlightening all from the height of the sky, he is as the sun hidden below the earth. I can well believe that the writer had the last king of Shang in his mind."

The important place occupied by the wife in the family is seen in the short sentence of the Thwan. That she be firm and correct, and do her part well, is the first thing necessary to its regulation.\nLine 1 is strong, and in a strong place. It suggests the necessity of strict rule in governing the family. Regulations must be established, and their observance strictly insisted on.\nLine 2 is weak, and in the proper place for it,\u2014the centre, moreover, of the lower trigram. It fitly represents the wife, and what is said on it tells us of her special sphere and duty; and that she should be unassuming in regard to all beyond her sphere; always being firm and correct. See the Shih, III, 350.\nLine 3 is strong, and in an odd place. If the place were central, the strength would be tempered; but the subject of the line, in the topmost place of the trigram, may be expected to exceed in severity. But severity is not a bad thing in regulating a family;\u2014it is better than laxity and indulgence.\nLine 4 is weak, and in its proper place. The wife is again suggested to us, and we are told, that notwithstanding her being confined to the internal affairs of the household, she can do much to enrich the family.\nThe subject of the strong fifth line appears as the king. This may be the husband spoken of as also a king; or the real king whose merit is revealed first in his family, as often in the Shih, where king Wn is the theme. The central place here tempers the display of the strength and power.\nLine 6 is also strong, and being in an even place, the subject of it might degenerate into stern severity, but he is supposed to be sincere, complete in his personal character and self-culture, and hence his action will only lead to good fortune."

Khwei denotes a social state in which division and mutual alienation prevail, and the hexagram teaches how in small matters this condition may be healed, and the way prepared for the cure of the whole system. The writer o: writers of Appendixes I and II point out the indication in the figure of division and disunion according to their views. In Appendix VI those things appear as a necessary sequel to the regulation of the family; while it is impossible to discover any allusion to the family in the Text.\nLine 1 is strong, and in an odd place. A successful course might be auspiced for its subject; but the correlate in line 4 is also strong; and therefore disappointment and repentance are likely to ensue. In the condition, however, indicated by Khwei, where people have a common virtue, they will help one another. Through the good services of 4, the other will not have to repent. His condition may be emblemed by a traveller\u2019s loss of his horses, which return to him of themselves.\nShould he meet with bad men, however, let him not shrink from them. Communication with them will be of benefit. His good may overcome their evil, and at least it will help to silence their slanderous tongues.\nLine 5 is weak, and its subject is the proper correlate of the strong 2. They might meet openly; but for the separation and disunion that mark the time. A casual, as it were a stolen, interview, as in a bye-lane or passage, however will be useful, and may lead on to a better understanding.\nLine 3 is weak, where it ought to be strong. Its correlate, however, in 6 is strong, and the relation between them might seem what it ought to be. But the weak 3 is between the strong lines in 2 and 4; and ina time of disunion there ensue the checking and repulsion emblemed in the Text. At the same time the subject of line 6 inflicts on that of 3 the punishments which are mentioned. It is thus bad for 3 at first, but we are told that in the end it will be well with him; and this will be due to the strength of the sixth line. The conclusion grows out of a conviction in the mind of the author that what is right and good is destined to triumph over what is wrong and bad. Disorder shall in the long run give place to order, and disunion to union.\nLine 4 has no proper correlate, and might seem to be solitary. But, as we saw on line 1, in this hexagram, correlates of the same class help each other. Hence the subjects of 4 and 1, meeting together, work with good will and success.\nThe place of 5 is odd, but the line itself is weak, so that there might arise occasion for repentance. But the strong 2 is a proper correlate to the weak 5. Five being the sovereign\u2019s place, the subject of 2 is styled the sovereign\u2019s relative, of the same surname with him, and head of some branch of the descendants of the royal house. It is as easy for 5, so supported, to deal with the disunion of the time, as to bite through a piece of skin.\nLine 6 is an even place, and yet the line is strong;\u2014what can its subject effect? He looks at 3, which, as weak, is a proper correlate; but he looks with the evil eye of disunion. The subject of 3 appears no better than a filthy pig, nor more real than an impossible carriage-load of ghosts. He bends his bow against him, but he unbends it, discovering a friend in 3, as 1 did in 4, and 5 in 2. He acts and with good luck, comparable to the falling rain, which results from the happy union of the yang and yin in nature."

Kien is the symbol for incompetency in the feet and legs, involving difficulty in walking; hence it is used in this hexagram to indicate a state of the kingdom which makes the government of it an arduous task. How this task may be successfully performed, now by activity on the part of the ruler, and now by a discreet inactivity :\u2014this is what the figure teaches, or at least gives hints about. For the development of the meaning of the symbolic character from the structure of the lineal figure, see Appendixes I and II.\nThe Thwan seems to require three things\u2014attention to place, the presence of the great man, and the firm observance of correctness\u2014in order to cope successfully with the difficulties of the situation. The first thing is enigmatically expressed, and the language should be compared with what we find in the Thwan of hexagrams 2 and 4o. Referring to Figure 2, in Plate III, we find that, according to W\u01cen\u2019s arrangement of the trigrams, the southwest is occupied by Khw\u01cen (\u2630), and the north-east by K\u01cen (\u2636). The former represents the champaign country; the latter, the mountainous region. The former is easily traversed and held; the latter, with difficulty. The attention to place thus becomes transformed into a calculation of circumstances; those that promise success in an enterprise, which should be taken advantage of, and those that threaten difficulty and failure, which should be shunned.\nThis is the generally accepted view of this difficult passage. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors have a view of their own. I have been myself inclined to find less symbolism in it, and to take the southwest as the regions in the south and west of the kingdom, which we know from the Shih were more especially devoted to Wan and his house, while the strength of the kings of Shang lay in the north and east.\n\u2018The idea of \u201cthe great man,\u201d Mencius\u2019s \u201cminister of Heaven,\u201d\u2019 is illustrated by the strong line in the fifth place, having for its correlate the weak line in 2. But favourableness of circumstances and place, and the presence cf the great man do not dispense from the observance of firm correctness. Throughout these essays of the Yf this is always insisted on.\nLine 1 is weak, whereas it ought to be strong as being in an odd place. If its subject advance, he will not be able to cope with the difficulties of the situation, but be overwhelmed by them. Let him wait for a more favourable time.\nLine 2 is weak, but in its proper place. Its correlation with the Strong 5, and consequent significance, are well set forth.\nLine 3 is strong, and in a place of strength; but its correlate in 6 is weak, so that the advance of its subject would be unsupported. He waits therefore for a better time, and cherishes the subjects of the two lines below, who naturally cling to him.\nLine 4 is weak, and, though in its proper place, its subject could do little of himself. He is immediately below the king or great man, however, and cultivates his loyal attachment to him, waiting for the time when he shall be required to act.\nLine 5 is the king, the man great and strong. He can cope with the difficulties, and the subjects of 2 and the other lines of the lower trigram give their help.\nThe action of the hexagram is over; where can the weak 6 go forward to? Let him abide where he is, and serve the great man immediately below him. So shall he also be great;\u2014in meritorious action at least."

The object of the author is to show, as if from the lines of the figure, how this new and better state of the kingdom is to be dealt with. See what is said on the Thwan of Kien for \u2018the advantage to be found in the south-west.\u2019 If further active operations be not necessary to complete the subjugation of the country, the sooner things fall into their old channels the better. The new masters of the kingdom should not be anxious to change all the old manners and ways. Let them do, as the duke of K\u00e2u actually did do with the subjugated people of Shang. If further operations be necessary, let them be carried through without delay. Nothing is said in the Thwan about the discountenancing and removal of small men,\u2014unworthy ministers or officers; but that subject appears in more than one of the lines.\nThere is a weak line, instead of a strong, in the first place; but this is compensated for by its strong correlate in 4.\nK\u00fb Hs\u00ee says he does not understand the symbolism under line 2. The place is even, but the line itself is strong; the strength therefore is modified or tempered. And 2 is the correlate of the ruler in 5. We are to look to its subject therefore for a minister striving to realise the idea of the hexagram, and pacify the subdued kingdom. He becomes a hunter, and disposes of unworthy men, represented by \u2018the three foxes.\u2019 He also gets the yellow arrows,\u2014the instruments used in war or in hunting, whose colour is \u2018correct,\u2019 and whose form is \u2018straight.\u2019 His firm correctness will be good.\nLine 3 is weak, when it should be strong; and occupying, as it does, the topmost place of the lower trigram, it suggests the symbolism of a porter in a carriage. People will say, \u2018How did he get there? The things cannot be his own.\u2019 And robbers will attack and plunder him. The subject of the line cannot protect himself, nor accomplish anything good.\nWhat is said on the fourth line appears in the form of an address to its subject. The line is strong in an even place, and 1, its correlate, is weak in an odd place. Such a union will not be productive of good. In the symbolism 1 becomes the toe of the subject of 4. How the friend or friends, who are to come to him on the removal of this toe, are represented, I do not perceive.\nLine 5 is weak in an odd place; but the place is that of the ruler, to whom it belongs to perfect the idea of the hexagram by removing all that is contrary to the peace and good order of the kingdom. It will be his duty to remove especially all the small men represented by the divided lines, which he can do with the help of his strong correlate in 2. Then even the small men will change their ways, and repair to him.\nLine 6 is the highest line in the figure, but not the place of the ruler. Hence it appears as occupied by a feudal duke, who carries out the idea of the figure against small men, according to the symbolism employed."

Sun is the symbol for the idea of diminishing or diminution; and what is said in Appendix I has made it to be accepted as teaching the duty of the subject to take of what is his and contribute to his ruler, or the expenses of the government under which he lives; in other words, readily and cheerfully to pay his taxes. P. Regis says, \u2018Sun seu (vectigalis causa) minuere . . . . est valde utile;\u2019 and Canon McClatchie in translating Appendix I has :\u2014\u2018Diminishing (by taxation for instance) ... . is very lucky.\u2019 Possibly, king W\u01cen may have seen in the figures the subject of taxation; but the symbolism of his son takes a much wider range. My own reading of the figure and Text comes near to the view of Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, that \u2018every diminution and repression of what we have in excess to bring it into accordance with right and reason is comprehended under Sun.\u2019\nLet there be sincerity in doing this, and it will lead to the happiest results. It will lead to great success in great things; and if the correction, or it may be a contribution towards it, appear to be very small, yet it will be accepted;\u2014as in the most solemn religious service. This is substantially the view of the hexagram approved by the Kh\u01ceng-hs\u00ee editors.\nLine 1 is strong, and its correlate in 4 is weak. Its subject will wish to help the subject of 4; but will not leave anything of his own undone in doing so. Nor will he diminish of his own for the other without due deliberation.\nLine 2 is strong, and in the central place. But it is in the place of a weak line, and its subject should maintain his position without moving to help his correlate in 5. Maintaining his own firm correctness is the best way to help him.\nParagraph 3 is to my mind full of obscurity. K\u00fb Hs\u00ee, adopting the view in Appendix I, says that the lower trigram was originally Khien, three undivided lines, like \u2018three men walking together,\u2019 and that the third line, taken away and made to be the topmost line, or the third, 1n what was originally Khw\u01cen, three divided lines, was \u2018the putting away of one man;\u2019 and that then the change of place by 3 and 6, while they continued their proper correlation, was, one going away, and finding his friend. I cannot lay hold of any thread of reason in this.\nLine 4 is weak, and in an even place; like an individual ailing and unable to perform his proper work. But the correlate in 1 1s strong; and is made to hasten to its relief. The \u2018joy\u2019 of the line shows the desire of its subject to do his part in the work of the hexagram.\nLine 5 is the seat of the ruler, who is here humble, and welcomes the assistance of his correlate, the subject of 2. He is a ruler whom all his subjects of ability will rejoice to serve in every possible way; and the result will be great good fortune.\nLine 6 has been changed from a weak into a strong line from line 3; has received therefore the greatest increase, and will carry out the idea of the hexagram in the highest degree and style.\nBut he can give increase to others without diminishing his own resources, and of course the benefit he will confer will be incalculable. Ministers will come to serve him; and not one from each clan merely, but many. Such is the substance of what is said on this last paragraph. I confess that I only discern the meaning darkly."

What king Wan had in his mind, in connexion with the hexagram, was a ruler or a government operating so as to dispense benefits to, and increase the resources of all the people. Two indications are evident in the lines;\u2014the strong line in the ruler\u2019s seat, or the fifth line, and the weak line in the correlative place of 2. Whether there be other indications in the figure or its component trigrams will be considered in dealing with the Appendixes. The writer might well say, on general grounds, of the ruler whom he had in mind, that he would be successful in his enterprises and overcome the greatest difficulties.\nLine 1 is strong, but its low position might seem to debar its subject from any great enterprise. Favoured as he 1s, however, according to the general idea of the hexagram, and specially responding to the proper correlate in 4, it is natural that he should make a movement; and great success will make his rashness be forgotten.\nWith paragraph 2 compare paragraph 5 of the preceding hexagram. Line 2 is weak, but in the centre, and is the correlate of 5. Friends give its subject the valuable gifts mentioned; \u2018that is,\u2019 says Kwo Yung (Sung dynasty), \u2018men benefit him; the oracles of the divination are in his favour,\u2014spirits, that is, benefit him; and finally, when the king sacrifices to God, He accepts. Heaven confers benefit from above.\u2019\nLine 3 is weak, neither central, no in its correct position. It would seem therefore that its subject should have no increase given to him. But it is the time for giving increase, and the idea of his receiving it by means of evil things is put into the line. That such things serve for reproof and correction is well known to Chinese moralists. But the paragraph goes on also to caution and admonish.\nLine 4 is the place for a minister, near to that of the ruler. Its subject is weak, but his place is appropriate, and as he follows the due course, his ruler will listen to him, and he will be a support in the most critical movements. Changing the capital from place to place was frequent in the feudal times of China. That of Shang, which preceded K\u00e2u, was changed five times.\nLine 5 is strong, in its fitting position, and central. It is the seat of the ruler, who has his proper correlate in 2. Everything good, according to the conditions of the hexagram, therefore, may be said of him;\u2014as is done.\nLine 6 is also strong; but it should be weak. Occupying the topmost place of the figure, its subject will concentrate his powers in the increase of himself, and not think of benefiting those below him; and the consequence will be as described."

This then is the subject of the hexagram,\u2014how bad men, statesmen corrupt and yet powerful, are to be put out of the way. And he who would accomplish the task must do so by the force of his character more than by force of arms, and by producing a general sympathy on his side.\nThe Thwan says that he must openly denounce the criminal in the court, seek to awaken general sympathy, and at the same time go about his enterprise, conscious of its difficulty and danger. Among his own adherents, moreover, as if it were in his own city, he must make it understood how unwillingly he takes up arms. Then let him go forward, and success will attend him.\nLine 1 is strong, the first line of that trigram, which expresses the idea of strength. But it is in the lowest place. The stage of the enterprise is too early, and the preparation too small to make victory certain. Its subject had better not take the field.\nLine 2 is strong, and central, and its subject is possessed with the determination to do his part in the work of removal.

Its subject therefore will not be at rest, nor able to do anything to accomplish the idea of the hexagram. He is symbolised by a culprit, who, according to the ancient and modern custom of Chinese courts, has been bastinadoed till he presents the appearance in the Text. Alone he can do nothing; if he could follow others, like a sheep led along, he might accomplish something, but he will not listen to advice.\nPurslain grows in shady places, and hence we find it here in close contiguity to the topmost line, which is yin. As 5 is the ruler\u2019s seat, evil may come to him from such contiguity, and Strenuous efforts must be made to prevent such an evil. The subject of the line, the ruler in the central place, will commit no error. It must be allowed that the symbolism in this line 1s not easily managed.\nThe subject of the 6th lime, standing alone, may be easily disposed of."

But the innings of the divided line commence again; and here we have in K\u00e2u the hexagram of the fifth month, when light and heat are supposed both to begin to be less.\nIn that divided line W\u01cen saw the symbol of the small or unworthy man, beginning to insinuate himself into the government of the country. His influence, if unchecked, would go on to grow, and he would displace one good man after another, and fill the vacant seats with others like-minded with himself. The object of W\u01cen in his Thwan, therefore, was to enjoin resistance to the encroachment of this bad man.\nK\u00e2u is defined as giving the idea of suddenly and casually encountering or meeting with. So does the divided line appear all at once in the figure. And this significance of the name rules in the interpretation of the lines, so as to set on one side the more common interpretation of them according to the correlation; showing how the meaning of the figures was put into them from the minds of W\u01cen and Tan in the first place. The sentiments of the Text are not learned from them; but they are forced and twisted, often fantastically, and made to appear to give those sentiments forth of themselves.\nHere the first line, divided, where it ought to be the contrary, becomes the symbol of a bold, bad woman, who appears unexpectedly on the scene, and wishes to subdue or win all the five strong lines to herself. No one would contract a marriage with such a female; and every good servant of his country will try to repel the entrance into the government of every officer who can be so symbolised.\nLine 1 represents the b\u00eate noire of the figure. If its subject can be kept back, the method of firm government and order will proceed. If he cannot be restrained, he will become disgusting and dangerous. It is not enough for the carriage to be stopt by the metal drag; it is also tied or bound to some steadfast object. Internal and external restraints should be opposed to the bad man.\nThe \u2018wallet of fish\u2019 under line 2 is supposed to symbolise the subject of line 1. It has come into the possession of the subject of 2, by virtue of the meaning of the name K\u00e2u, which I have pointed out. With his strength therefore he can repress the advance of 1. He becomes in fact \u2018the lord of the hexagram,\u2019 and all the other strong lines are merely guests; and especially is it important that he should prevent 1 from approaching them. This is a common explanation of what is said under this second line. It seems farfetched; but I can neither find nor devise anything better.\nWith what is said on line 3, compare the fourth paragraph of the duke\u2019s Text on the preceding hexagram. Line 3 is strong, but has gone beyond the central place; has no correlate above; and is cut off from 1 by the intervening 2. It cannot do much therefore against 1, but its aim being to repress that, there will be no great error.\nLine 1 is the proper correlate of 4; but it has already met and associated with 2. The subject of 4 therefore stands alone; and evil to him may be looked for.\nLine 5 is strong, and in the ruler\u2019s place. Its relation to 1 is like that of a forest tree to the spreading gourd. But let not its subject use force to destroy or repress the growth of 1; but let him restrain himself and keep his excellence concealed, and Heaven will set its seal to his virtue.\nThe symbolism of line 6 is difficult to understand, though the meaning of what is said is pretty clear. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors observe:\u2014\u2018The subject of this line is like an officer who has withdrawn from the world. He can accomplish no service for the time; but his person is removed from the workers of disorder.\u2019"

The character Sh\u01ceng is used of advancing in an upward direction, \u2018advancing and ascending.\u2019 And here, as the name of the hexagram, it denotes the advance of a good officer to the highest pinnacle of distinction. The second line, in the centre of the lower trigram, is strong, but the strength is tempered by tts being in an even place. As the representative of the subject of the hexagram, it shows him to be possessed of modesty and force. Then the ruler\u2019s seat, the fifth place, is occupied by a divided line, indicating that he will welcome the advance of 2. The officer therefore both has the qualities that fit him to advance, and a favourable opportunity to do so. The result of his advance will be fortunate.\nIt is said that after he has met with the ruler, \u2018the great man\u2019 in 5, \u2018advance to the south will be fortunate.\u2019 AG Hsf and other critics say that \u2018advancing to the south\u2019 is equivalent simply to \u2018advancing forwards.\u2019 The south is the region of brightness and warmth; advance towards it will be a joyful progress. As P. Regis explains the phrase, the traveller will proceed \u2018via recta simillima ill qua itur ad austiates felicesque plagas.\u2019\n\nLine 1 is weak, where it should be strong; its subject, that is, is humble and docile. Those above him, therefore, welcome his advance. Another interpretation of the line is suggested by Appendix I; which deserves consideration. As the first line of Sun, moreover, it may be supposed to concentrate in itself its attribute of docility, and be the lord of the trigram.\nSee on the second line of \u017dhui. Line 2 is strong, and the weak 5 is its proper correlate. We have a strong officer serving a weak ruler; he could not do so unless he were penetrated with a sincere and devoted loyalty.\nParagraph 3 describes the boldness and fearlessness of the advance of the third line. According to the Khang-hs\u00ee editors, who, I think, are right, there is a shade of condemnation in the line. Its subject is too bold.\nLine 4 occupies the place of a great minister, in immediate contiguity to his ruler, who confides in him, and raises him to the highest distinction as a feudal prince. The mention of mount Kh\u00ee, at the foot of which was the capital of the lords of K\u00e2u, seems to take the paragraph out of the sphere of symbolism into that of history. \u2018The king\u2019 in it is the last sovereign of Shang; the feudal prince in it is W\u01cen.\nIn line 5 the advance has reached the highest point of dignity, and firm correctness is specially called for. \u2018Ascending the steps of a stair\u2019 may intimate, as K\u00fb Hs\u00ee says, the ease of the advance; or according to others (the Khang-hs\u00ee editors among them), its ceremonious manner.\nWhat can the subject of the hexagram want more? He has gained all his wishes, and still he is for going onwards. His advance is blind and foolish; and only the most exact correctness will save him from the consequences."

The character Khw\u01cen presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure; \u2018a plant,\u2019 according to Williams, \u2018fading for want of room;\u2019 \u2018a tree,\u2019 according to Tai Tung, \u2018not allowed to spread its branches.\u2019 However this be, the term conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed; and this hexagram indicates a state of things in which the order and government that would conduce to the well-being of the country can hardly get the development, which, by skilful management on the part of \u2018the great man\u2019 and others, is finally secured for them.\nLooking at the figure we see that the two central places are occupied by strong lines; but 2 is confined between 1 and 3, both of which are weak, and 5 (the ruler), as well as 4 (his minister), is covered by the weak 6; all which peculiarities are held to indicate the repression or straitening of good men by bad. For the way in which the same view is derived from the great symbolism, see Appendix II, in loc.\nThe concluding sentence of the Thwan is literally, \u2018If he speak, he will not be believed;\u2019 but the Khang-hs\u00ee editors give sufficient reasons for changing one character so as to give the meaning in the translation. \u2018Actions,\u2019 not words, are what are required in the case.\nThe symbolism of \u2018buttocks\u2019 is rather a favourite with the duke of K\u00e2u;\u2014\u2018chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt.\u2019 The poor subject of line 1 sitting on a mere stump, which affords him no shelter, is indeed badly off.\nThe line is at the bottom of the trigram indicating peril, and 4, which is its proper correlate, is so circumstanced as not to be able to render it help; hence comes the unfavourable auspice. \u2018Three years\u2019 is used, as often, for a long time.\nThe three strong lines in the figure (2, 4, and 5) are all held to represent \u2018superior men;\u2019 and their being straitened is not in their persons or estates, but in their principles which are denied development. Hence the subject of 2 is straitened while he fares sumptuously. His correlate in 5, though not quite proper, occupies the ruler\u2019s place, and comes to his help. \u2018That it is the ruler who comes appears from his red or vermillion knee-covers, different from the scarlet knee-covers worn by nobles, as in paragraph 5. Let 2 cultivate his sincerity and do the work of the hexagram as if he were sacrificing to spiritual beings; and then, if he keep quiet, all will be well.\nFor \u2018a full explanation\u2019 of paragraph 3 K\u00fb Hs\u00ee refers his readers to what Confucius is made to say on it in Appendix III, ii, 35. The reader, however, will probably not find much light in that passage. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors say here:\u2014\u2018The subjects of the three divided lines (1, 3, and 6) are all unable to deal aright with the straitened state indicated by the figure. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The second, occupies the third place, where he may either advance or retreat; and he advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to his family, and finds none to receive him; so graphically is there set forth the distress which reckless action brings.\u2019\nLine 4 is the proper correlate of 1, but it is a strong line in an even place, and its assistance is given dilatorily. \u2018Then 1 is overridden by 2, which is represented by \u2018a chariot of metal.\u2019 It is difficult for the subjects of 1 and 4 to come together, and effect much; but 4 is near 5, which is also a strong line. Through a common sympathy, the subject of 5 will have a measure of success. So the symbolism of this line has been explained,\u2014not very satisfactorily.\nLine 5 is repressed by 6, and pressed on by 4. Above and below its subject is wounded. Especially is he straitened by the minister in 4, with his scarlet knee-covers. But the upper trigram is Tui, with the quality of complacent satisfaction. And this indicates, it is said, that the subject of 5 gets on notwithstanding his straits, especially by his sincerity. This explanation is not more satisfactory than the last.\nLine 6 is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its height. Its subject appears bound and on a perilous summit. But his extremity is also his opportunity. He is moved to think of repenting; and if he do repent, and go forward, his doing so will be fortunate."

The character originally was pictorial (34), intended to represent a portion of land, divided into nine parts, the central portion belonging to the government, and being cultivated by the joint labour of the eight families settled on the other divisions. In the centre of it, moreover, was a well, which was the joint property of all the occupants.\nWhat is said on \u017ding might be styled \u2018Moralisings on a well,\u2019 or \u2018Lessons to be learned from a well for the good order and government of a country.\u2019 What a well is to those in its neighbourhood, and indeed to men in general, that is government to a people.\nIf rulers would only rightly appreciate the principles of government handed down from the good ages of the past, and faithfully apply them to the regulation of the present, they would be blessed themselves and their people with them.\nIn the Thwan we have the well, substantially the same through many changes of society; a sure source of dependance to men, for their refreshment and for use in their cultivation of the ground. Its form is what I have seen in the plains of northern China; what may be seen among ourselves in many places in Europe. It is deep, and the water is drawn up by a vessel let down from the top; and the value of the well depends on the water being actually raised. And so the principles of government must be actually carried out.\nLine 1, being weak, and at the very bottom of the figure, suggests, or is made to suggest, the symbolism of it. Many men in authority are like such a well; corrupt, useless, unregarded.\nLine 2 is strong, and might very well symbolise an active spring, ever feeding the well and, through it, the ground and its cultivators; but it is in an inappropriate place, and has no proper correlate.\nIts cool waters cannot be brought to the top. So important is it that the ministers of a country should be able and willing rightly to administer its government. In the account of the ancient Shun it is stated that he once saved his life by an opening in the lining of a well.\nLine 3 is a strong line, in its proper place; and must represent an able minister or officer. But though the well is clear, no use is made of it. I do not find anything in the figure that can be connected with this fact. The author was wise beyond his lines. After the first sentence of the paragraph, the duke of Au ceases from his function of making emblems; reflects and moralises.\nLine 4 is weak, but in its proper place. Its subject is not to be condemned, but neither is he to be praised. He takes care of himself, but does nothing for others.\nLine 5 is strong, and in its right place. The place is that of the ruler, and suggests the well, full of clear water, which is drawn up, and performs its useful work. Such is the good Head of government to his people.\nLine 6 is in its proper place, but weak. If the general idea of the figure was different, a bad auspice might be drawn from it.\nBut here we see in it the symbol of the water drawn up, and the top uncovered so that the use of the well is free to all. Then the mention of \u2018sincerity\u2019 suggests the inexhaustibleness of the elemental supply."

Originally used for the skin of an animal or bird, alive or dead, it received the significance of changing at a very early time. Its earliest appearance, indeed, in the first Book of the Sh\u00fb, is in that sense. How the transition was made from the idea of a skin or hide to that of change is a subject that need not be entered on here. The author has before him the subject of changes occurring\u2014called for\u2014in the state of the country; it may be on the greatest scale. The necessity of them is recognised, and hints are given as to the spirit and manner in which they should be brought about.\nFor the way in which the notion of change is brought out of the trigrams of the figure, see Appendixes I and II. It is assumed in the Thwan that change is viewed by people generally with suspicion and dislike, and should not be made hastily. When made as a necessity, and its good effects appear, the issues will be great and good. A proved necessity for them beforehand; and a firm correctness in the conduct of them:\u2014these are the conditions by which changes should be regulated.\nLine 1, at the bottom of the figure, may be taken as denoting change made at too early a period. It has no proper correlate or helper, moreover, above. Hence its subject is represented as tied up, unable to take any action.\nLine 2, though weak, is in its correct place. It is in the centre also of the trigram L\u00ee, signifying brightness and intelligence, and has a proper correlate in the strong 5. Let its subject take action in the way of change.\nThe symbolism of paragraph 3 is twofold. The line is strong, and in the correct position, but it has passed the centre of Sun and is on its outward verge. These conditions may dispose its subject to reckless and violent changing which would be bad. But if he act cautiously and with due deliberation, he may take action, and he will be believed in.\nLine 4 is strong, but in the place of a weak line. This might vitiate any action of its subject in the way of change, and give occasion for repentance. But other conditions are intimated that will have a contrary effect; and if he have further secured general confidence, he may proceed to the greatest changes, even to change the dynasty,\u2014\u2018with good fortune. The conditions favourable to his action are said to be such as these:\u2014The line has passed from the lower trigram into the upper; water and fire come in it into contact; the fourth place is that of the minister immediately below the ruler\u2019s seat. All these considerations demand action from the subject of 4 in harmony with the idea of the hexagram.\nLine 5 has every quality proper to \u2018the lord of the hexagram,\u2019 and his action will be in every way beneficial. He is symbolled by the tiger; and the changes which he makes by the bright stripes of the tiger when he has changed his coat.\nLine 6 is weak, but its subject is penetrated with the spirit of the hexagram. If its subject be a superior man, only inferior to \u2018the great man,\u2019 immediately below, the changes he makes will be inferior only to his. If he be a small man, he will be compliant and submissive. The lesson for him, however, is to abide firm and correct without taking any action of his own."

		"footnote": "L. Ting was originally a pictorial character, representing a caldron with three feet and two ears, used for cooking and preparing food for the table (the mat in old times) and the altar. The picture has disappeared from the character, but it is said that in the hexagram we have an outline from which fancy may construct the vessel. The lower line, divided, represents its feet; lines 2, 3, 4, all undivided, represent the body of it; line 5, divided, represents its two ears; and line 6, undivided, the handle by which it was cariied, or suspended from a hook. Appendix VI makes Ting follow Ko in the order of the hexagrams, because there is no changer of the appearance and character of things equal to the furnace and caldron!\nTing and \u017ding (48) are the only two hexagrams named from things in ordinary use with men; and they are both descriptive of the government\u2019s work of nourishing. There are three hexagrams of which that is the theme, I (27), under which we are told in Appendix I that \u2018the sages nourished men of worth, by means of them to reach to the myriads of the people.\u2019 \u017ding treats of the nourishment of the people generally by the government through its agricultural and other methods; Ting treats of the nourishment of men of talents and virtue; and that being understood, it is said, without more ado, that it \u2018intimates great progress and success.\u2018 The Text that follows, however, is more difficult to interpret than that of Sing.\nLine 1 is weak, and little or nothing can be expected from its subject. But it has a proper correlate in the strong 4; and the disastrous overthrow, causing the feet to be directed towards 4, is understood to be lucky, as accelerating the co-operation of their two lines! The overturned caldron is thereby emptied of bad stuff that had accumulated in it!! The writer uses another illustration, which comes to the same thing. A concubine is less honourable than a wife,\u2014like the oveithrown caldron. But if she have a son, while the proper wife has none, he will be his father\u2019s heir, and the mother, the concubine, will share in the honour of his position. Thus the issue of what was so unpromising is good. At least \u2018there is no mistake.\u2019 The above is what is found in the best commentaries on the paragraph. I give it, but am myself dissatisfied with it.\nLine 2 is strong. \u2018The enemy\u2019 is the first line, which solicits 1. One, however, is able to resist the solicitation; and the whole paragraph gives a good auspice. The personal pronoun seems to show that the whole was, or was intended to be, understood as an oracular response in divination. This paragraph is rhymed, moreover, as are also 1, 3, and 4:\u2014\n\t\u2018In the caldron is good fare, See my foe with angry glare;\n\tBut touch me he does not dare.\u2019\nLine 3 is also strong, and in the proper place; and if its correlate were the divided 5, its auspice would be entirely good. But instead of 5, its correlate is the strong 6. The place of the ears at 5 has been changed. Things promise badly. The advance of 3 is stopped. The good meat in the caldron which it symbolises will not be eaten. But 3 keeping firm 5 will by and by seek its society! The yin and the yang will mingle, and their union will be followed by genial rain. The issue will be good.\nLine 4 is in the place of a great minister, who is charged with the most difficult duties, which no single man can sustain. Then the strength of 4 is weakened by being in an even place, and its correlate is the weak 1 in the lowest place. Its subject is insufficient of himself for his work, and he has no sufficient help; and the result will be evil.\n\u2018Paragraph 5,\u2019 says the Daily Lecture, \u2018praises the ruler as condescending to the worthy with his humble virtue.\u2019 \u2018Yellow\u2019 has occurred repeatedly as \u2018a correct colour;\u2019 and here \u2018the yellow ears and strong rings of metal\u2019 are intended to intensify our appreciation of the occupant of 5. As the line is divided, a caution is added about being firm and correct.\nLine 6 is strong, but the strength is tempered by its being in an even place. It is this which makes the handle to be of jade, which, though very hard, is supposed to have a peculiar and rich softness of its own. The auspice of the line is very good. \u2018The great minister,\u2019 it is said, \u2018the subject of 6,\u2019 performs for the ruler, the subject of 5, in helping his government and nourishing the worthy, the part which the handle does for the caldron."

		"footnote": "LI. K\u01cen among the trigrams represents thunder, and, according to Wan\u2019s arrangement and significance of them, \u2018the oldest son.\u2019 It is a phonetic character in which the significant constituent is Y\u00fc, meaning rain, and with which are formed most characters that denote atmospherical phenomena. The hexagram is formed of the trigram K\u01cen redoubled, and may be taken as representing the crash or peal of thunder; but we have seen that the attribute or virtue of the trigram is \u2018moving, exciting power;\u2019 and thence, symbolically, the character is indicative of movement taking place in society or in the kingdom. This is the meaning of the hexagram; and the subject is the conduct to be pursued in a time of movement\u2014such as insurrection or revolution\u2014by the party promoting, and most interested in, the situation. It is shown how he ought to be aware of the dangers of the time, and how by precaution and the regulation of himself he may overcome them.\nThe indication of a successful issue given by the figure is supposed to be given by the undivided line at the bottom of the trigram. The subject of it must be superior to the subjects of the two divided lines above. It is in the idea of the hexagram that he should be moving and advancing;\u2014and what can his movement be but successful?\nThe next sentence shows him sensible of the danger of the occasion, but confident and self-possessed. The concluding sentence shows him rapt in his own important affairs, like a sincere worshipper, thinking only of the service in which he is engaged. Such a symbol is said to be suggested by W\u01cen\u2019s significance of K\u01cen as \u2018the oldest son (page 33).\u2019 It is his to succeed to his father, and the hexagram, as following Ting, shows him presiding over the sacrifices that have been prepared in the caldron. This is too fanciful.\nWhat is said on line 1 is little more than a repetition of the principal part of the Thwan. The line is undivided, and gives the auspice of good fortune.\n\u2018The position of peril\u2019 to the subject of line 2 is suggested, as Appendix II says, by its position, immediately above 1. But the rest of the symbolism is obscure, and K\u00fb Hs\u00ee says he does not understand it. The common interpretation appears in the version. The subject of the line does what he can to get out of danger; and finally, as is signified by the central position of the line, the issue is better than could have been expected. On the specification of \u2018seven days,\u2019 see what is said in the treatise on the Thwan of hexagram 24. On its use here Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze says:\u2014\u2018The places of a diagram amount to 6. The number 7 is the first of another. When the movement symbolised by K\u01cen is gone by, things will be as they were before.\u2019\nLine 3 is divided, and where an undivided line should be; but if its subject move on to the fourth place, which would be right for him, the issue will not be bad.\nThe 4th line, however, has a bad auspice of its own. It is undivided in an even place, and it is pressed by the divided line on either side, hence its subject is represented as supinely sinking in the mud.\nLine 5 is divided, in an odd place, and that in which the action of the hexagram may be supposed to be concentrated. Hence its subject is always in peril; but his central position indicates safety in the end.\nLine 6 is weak, and has to abide the concluding terrors of the movement. Action on the part of its subject is sure to be evil. If, however, he were to take precautions, he might escape with only the censures of his relatives. But I do not see anything in the figure to indicate this final symbolism. The writer, probably, had a case in his mind, which it suited; but what that was we do not know."

Mountains rise up grandly from the surface of the earth, and their masses rest on it in quiet and solemn majesty; and they serve also to arrest the onward progress of the traveller. Hence the attribute ascribed to K\u01cen is twofold; it is both active and passive\u2014resting and arresting.\nThe character is used in this hexagram with both of those significations. As the name of the figure, it denotes the mental characteristic of resting in what is right; especially resting, as it is expressed by Chinese critics, \u2018in principle,\u2014that which is right, on the widest scale, and in the absolute conception of the mind; and that which is right in every different position in which a man can be placed. We find this treated of in the Great Learning (Commentary, chapter 3), and in the Doctrine of the Mean, chapter 14, and other places. This is the theme of the hexagram; and the symbolism of it is all taken from different parts of the human body, as in hexagram 31, and the way in which they are dealt with. Several of the paragraphs are certainly not easy to translate and interpret.\nThe other parts of the body, such as the mouth, eyes, and ears, have their appetencies, which lead them to what is without themselves. The back alone has nothing to do with anything beyond itself\u2014hardly with itself even; all that it has to do is to stand straight and strong. So should it be with us, resting in principle, free from the intrusion of selfish thoughts and external objects.\nAmidst society, he who realises the idea of the hexagram is still alone, and does not allow himself to be distracted from the contemplation and following of principle. He is not a recluse, however, who keeps aloof from social life; but his distinction is that he maintains a supreme regard to principle, when alone, and when mingling with others.\nIn the symbolism the author rises from one part of the body to the other. The first line at the bottom of the figure fitly suggests \u2018the toes.\u2019 The lesson is that from the first men should rest in, and be anxious to do, what is right in all their affairs. The weakness of the line and its being in an odd place give occasion for the caution, with which the paragraph concludes.\nAbove the toes are the calves, represented by the second line, weak, but in its proper place. Above this, again, are the loins, represented by 3, strong, and in danger of being violent. Line 2 follows 3, and should help it; but is unable to do so; and there results dissatisfaction.\nWhen the calves are kept at rest, advance is stopped, but no other harm ensues. Not so when the loins are kept at rest, and unable to bend, for the connexion between the upper and lower parts of the body is then broken. The dissatisfaction increases to an angry heat. Paragraph 3 is unusually difficult. For \u2018loins\u2019 P. Regis has scapulae, and for ribs renes; Canon McClatchie says:\u2014\u2018Third Nine is stopping at a limit, and separating what is in continued succession (i.e. the backbone); thus the mind,\u2019 &c.\nLine 4 is a weak line resting in a proper place; hence it gives a good auspice. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors, however, call attention to the resting of the trunk as being inferior to the resting of the back in the Thwan.\nThe place of the weak fifth line is not proper for it; and this accounts for the mention of its subject \u2018repenting,\u2019 for which, however, there is not occasion.\nThe third line of the trigrams, and the sixth of the hexagram, is what makes K\u01cen what it is,\u2014the symbol of a mountain. The subject of it therefore will carry out the resting required by the whole figure in the highest style."

		"footnote": "LIII. Kien is ordinarily used in the sense of gradually; but there is connected with that the idea also of progress or advance. The element of meaning in the character is the symbol of water; and the whole of it denotes gradual advance, like the soaking in of water. Three hexagrams contain in them the idea of advance,\u2014\u017din (35), Sh\u01ceng (46), and this Kien; but each has its peculiarity of meaning, and that of Kien is the gradual manner in which the advance takes place. The subject then of the hexagram is the advance of men to offices in the state, how it should take place gradually and by successive steps, as well as on certain other conditions that may be gathered from the Text. P. Regis gives this exposition of the subject, as taken by him from the symbolism, which he ascribes to Confucius:\u2014\u2018Viri probi, seu republica digi, in virtutis soliditate instituendi sunt a sapiente, bonisque regulis ut altis radicibus firmandi, nec alii ad rempublicam tractandam promovendi, nisi qui paulatim per varios minoresque gradus ad magnum hoc regimen periculo facto ascendere digni sint.\u2019 He then illustrates this sentiment by the words of Pliny:\u2014\u2018Eligetur multis experimentis eruditus, et qui futura possit ex praeteritis praevidere.\u2019\nBut how does the lineal figure give the idea of a gradual advance? We shall see how it is attempted in the Great Symbolism to get this from the component trigrams. The account there is not satisfactory; and still less so is what else I have been able to find on the subject. E.g., the trigrams were originally Khw\u01cen and Khien; but the third line of Khw\u01cen and the first of Khien have changed places; and the trigrams now denote \u2018the youngest son,\u2019 and \u2018the eldest daughter.\u2019 If all this, which is a mere farrago, were admitted, it would not help us to the idea of an advance.\nAgain, the lines 2, 3, 4, 5 are all in the places proper to them as strong or weak; we ascend by them as by regular steps to the top of the hexagram; and this, it is said, gives the notion of the gradual steps of the advance. But neither does this carry conviction with it to the mind. We must leave the question. King Wan, for reasons which we cannot discover, or without such reasons, determined that the hexagram Kien should denote the gradual advance of men to positions of influence and office.\nThe marriage of a young lady is mentioned in the Thwan as an illustration of an important event taking place with various preliminary steps, continued from its initiation to its consummation. But all must be done in an orderly and correct manner. And so must it be with the rise of a man in the service of the state.\n\nThe goose from the most ancient times played an important part in the marriage ceremonies of the Chinese; and this may have suggested the use of it in the symbolism of the different lines. Its habits as a bird of passage, and flying in processional order, admirably suited the writer\u2019s purpose. In paragraph 1 it appears for the first time in the season approaching the shore. Then comes the real subject of the line; and the facts of its being weak, and without a proper correlate, agree with, if they do not suggest, what is said about him, and the caution added.\nThe geese have advanced in line 2, and so has the officer, though he is not mentioned. The line is weak or humble, and central, and has a proper correlate in 5. Hence comes the good auspice.\nLine 3 is strong, and has passed the central place, to the top of the lower trigram, and has not a proper correlate in 6. Its subject is likely to be violent and at the same time unsuccessful in his movements. He is like a husband who does not care for his wife, or a wife who does not care for her child. But in the case supposed, his strength in the end would be useful.\nThe web-footed goose is not suited for taking hold on the branches; but on flat branches it can rest. Line 4, weak, but in an even place, does not promise a good auspice for its subject; but it is the first hme in the trigram of humility, and it is concluded that he will not fall into error.\nLine 5 is a strong line in the ruler\u2019s seat; and yet it appears here as the symbol of a wife. Somehow its subject has been at variance with, and kept in disgrace by, calumniating enemies such as the plunderers of paragraph 3; but things come right in the end. The wife, childless for three years, becomes at last a mother; and there is good fortune.\nThe subject of line 6 has reached the top of the hexagram. There is no more advance for him; and he has no correlate. But he may still do some good work for the state, and verify the auspice derived from the ornamental plumes of the geese."

Mei Kwei is a common way of saying that a young lady is married, or, literally, \u2018is going home.\u2019 If the order of the characters be reversed, the verb kwei will be transitive, and the phrase will signify \u2018the marrying away of a daughter,\u2019 or \u2018the giving the young lady in marriage.\u2019 In the name of this hexagram, Kwei is used with this transitive force. But Mei means \u2018a younger sister, and not merely a young lady or a daughter. Kwei Mei might be equivalent to our \u2018giving in marriage;\u2019 but we shall find that the special term has a special appropriateness. The Thwan makes the hexagram give a bad auspice concerning its subject; and for this the following reasons are given:\u2014According to W\u01cen\u2019s symbolism of the trigrams, Tui, the lower trigram here, denotes the youngest daughter, and K\u01cen, the upper trigram, the oldest son. And as the action of the hexagram begins with that of the lower trigram, we have in the figure two violations of propriety. First, the marriage represented is initiated by the lady and her friends. She goes to her future home instead of the bridegroom coming to fetch her. Second, the parties are unequally matched. There ought not to be such disparity of age between them. Another reason assigned for the bad auspice is that lines 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all in places not suited to them, quite different from the corresponding lines in the preceding hexagram.\nIs then such a marriage as the above, or marriage in general, the theme of the hexagram? I think not. The marriage comes in, as in the preceding essay, by way of illustration. With all the abuses belonging to it as an institution of his country, as will immediately appear, the writer acknowledged it without saying a word in deprecation or correction of those abuses; but from the case he selected he wanted to set forth some principles which should obtain in the relation between a ruler and his ministers. This view is insisted on in Wan King\u2019s \u2018New Collection of Comments on the Y\u00ee (A.D. 1686).\u2019\nA feudal prince was said to marry nine ladies at once. The principal of them was the bride who was to be the proper wife, and she was attended by two others, virgins from her father\u2019s harem; a cousin, and a half-sister, a daughter of her father by another mother of inferior rank. Under line 1 the younger sister of the hexagram appears in the inferior position of this half-sister. But the line is strong, indicative in a female of firm virtue. The mean condition and its duties are to be deplored, and give the auspice of lameness; but notwithstanding, the secondary wife will in a measure discharge her service. There will be good fortune. Notwithstanding apparent disadvantages, an able officer may do his ruler good service.\nLine 2 is strong, and in the centre. The proper correlate is 5, which, however, is weak, and in the place of a strong line. With such a correlate, the able lady in 2 cannot do much in the discharge of her proper work. But if she think only of her husband, like the widow who will die rather than marry again, such devotion will have its effect and its reward. Though blind of one eye, she yet manages to see. And so devoted loyalty in an officer will compensate for many disadvantages.\nLine 3 is weak, where it should be strong; and the attribute of pleased satisfaction belonging to Tui culminates in its subject. She turns out to be of so mean a character and such a slave of passion that no one will marry her. She returns and accepts the position of a concubine.\nLine 4 is strong, where it should be weak; but in the case of a female the indication is not bad. The subject of the line, however, is in no haste. She waits, and the good time will come.\nKing T\u00ee-y\u00ee has been already mentioned under the fifth line of hexagram 11, and in connexion with some regulation which he made about the marriage of daughters of the royal house. His sister here is honourably mentioned, so as to suggest that the adorning which she preferred was \u2018the ornament of the hidden man of the heart.\u2019 The comparison of her to \u2018the moon almost full\u2019 I am ready to hail as an instance where the duke of K\u00e2u is for once poetical. Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, however, did not see poetry, but a symbol in it. \u2018The moon is not full,\u2019 he says, \u2018but only nearly full. A wife ought not to eclipse her husband!\u2019 However, the sister of T\u00ee-y\u00ee gets happily married, as she deserved to do, being represented by the line in the place of honour, having its proper correlate in 2.\nLine 6 is weak, at the top of the hexagram, and without a proper correlate. Hence its auspice is evil. The marriage-contract is broken, accoiding to K\u00fb Hs\u00ee, and does not take effect. The parties mentioned in the paragraph appear engaged in the temple, offering or sacrificing to the spirits of their ancestors. But the woman\u2019s basket which should contain her offerings (The Shih, I, ii, ode 4) is empty, and the man attempts to perform his part in slaying the victim (The Shih, II, vi, ode 6. 5) without effect."

		"footnote": "LV. The character F\u01ceng is the symbol of being large and abundant, and, as the name of this hexagram, denotes a condition of abundant prosperity. In the changes of human affairs a condition of prosperity has often given place to one of an opposite character. The lesson of the hexagram is to show to rulers how they may preserve the prosperity of their state and people. The component trigrams have the attributes of intelligence and of motive force, and the second is under the direction of the first. A ruler with these attributes is not likely to fail in maintaining his crown and prosperity, and it may well be said that the figure intimates progress and development. The king is told not to be anxious, but to study how he may always be like the sun in his meridian height, cheering and enlightening all.\nThe explanation of the Thwan is thus natural and easy. It will be found that a change is introduced in explaining the symbolism of the lines, which it is as well to point out here. Thus far we have found that to constitute a proper correlation between two lines, one of them must be whole, and the other divided. Here two undivided lines make a correlation. The law, evidently made for the occasion, goes far to upset altogether the doctrine of correlated lines. I have been surprised that the rules about the lines stated in the Introduction, pp. 15, 16, have held good so often. There have been various deviations from them, but none so gross as that in this hexagram.\nLine 1 is strong, and in an odd place. Its correlate is 4, which would in other figures be deemed unfortunate. But here even the Text calls 4 (for the reference must be to it) the mate of 1, and makes their belonging to different categories of no account. The lesson taught is that mutual helpfulness is the great instrument for the maintenance of prosperity. The subject of line 1 is encouraged to go forward.\nLine 2 is divided, and in its proper place. Occupying the centre of the trigram of brightness, the intelligence of it should be concentrated in its subject; but his correlate is the weak 5, weak and in an improper place, so that he becomes the benighted ruler, and darkness is shed from him down on 2, which is strangely symbolised. The subject of 2 therefore, if he advance, will not be acceptable to his ruler, and will not be employed. The only way in which he can be useful by developing the light that is in him is pointed out in the conclusion. The constellation of the Bushel corresponds to our Ursa Major, or perhaps part of Sagittarius.\nLine 3 is strong, in its proper place. It is the last line moreover of the trigram of Brightness. All these conditions are favourable to the employment of its subject; but its correlate is the weak 6, which is at the extremity of the trigram of movement. There is no more power therefore in 6, and the subject of 3 has no one to co-operate with him. His symbolism and auspice are worse than those of 2; but his own proper goodness and capacity will save him from error. Mei is a small star in or near the Bushel.\nThe symbolism of line 4 is the same as that of 2, till we come to the last sentence. Then there is the strange correlation of the two strong lines in 4 and 1; and the issue is good.\nThe subject of line 5 is in the ruler\u2019s place, himself weak, but \u2018the lord\u2019 of the trigram of movement. He can do little unhelped, but if he can bring into the work and employ in his service the talents of 1, 3, and 4, and even of 2, his correlate, the results will be admirable. Nothing consolidates the prosperity of a country so much as the co-operation of the ruler and able ministers.\nAll the conditions of line 6 are unfavourable, and its subject is left to himself without any helpers. He is isolated for long, and undone. The issue is only evil."

		"footnote": "LVI. The name L\u00fc denotes people travelling abroad, and is often translated by \u2018strangers.\u2019 As early as the time of king W\u01cen, there was a class of men who went about from one state to another, pursuing their business as pedlars or travelling merchants; but in Mencius IT, i, chap. 5. 3, it is used for travellers generally, whatever it was that took them out of their own states. Confucius himself is adduced as a travelling stranger; and in this hexagram king W\u01cen is supposed to have addressed himself to the class of such men, and told them how they ought to comport themselves. They ought to cultivate two qualities,\u2014those of humility and integrity (firm correctness). By means of these they would escape harm, and would make some little attainment and progress. Their rank was too low to speak of great things in connexion with them. It is interesting to find travellers, strangers in a strange land, having thus a place in the Y\u00ee.\nFor the manner in which the component trigrams are supposed to give the idea that is in L\u00fc, see Appendix II. In Appendix I there is an endeavour to explain the Thwan by means of the lines and their relation to one another.\nLine 1 is weak, in an odd place, and at the very bottom or commencement of the hexagram. These conditions are supposed to account for the unfavourable symbolism and auspice.\nLine 2 is weak, but in its proper place. That place, moreover, is the central. Hence the traveller\u2014and he might here very well be a travelling merchant\u2014is represented in the symbolism as provided with everything he can require; and though the auspice is not mentioned, we must understand it as being good.\nLine 3 is strong, and in an even place. But it occupies the topmost place in the lower trigram; and its strength may be expected to appear as violence. So it does in the symbolism, and extraordinary violence as well. It seems unreasonable to suppose, as in the conclusion, that one so described could be in any way correct. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors remark that the subjects of 2 and 3 are represented as having \u2018lodging-houses,\u2019 and not any of those of the other lines, because these are the only two lines in the places proper to them!\nLine 4 is strong, but in an even place. Hence its subject has not \u2018a lodging-house;\u2019 but has found a situation whee he has shelter, though he is exposed to perils. Hence he is represented as having an axe, which may be available for defence. Still he is not at peace in his mind. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors observe well that the mention of an axe makes us think of caution as a quality desirable in a traveller.\nLine 5, though weak, is in the centre of the upper trigram, which has the quality of brightness and elegance. It is held to be the lord of the trigram L\u00ee; and lines 4 and 6 are on either side in loyal duty to defend and help. Then the shooting a pheasant is supposed to be suggested; an elegant bird,\u2014by the trigram of elegance. When an Officer was travelling abroad in ancient times, his gift of introduction at any feudal court was a pheasant. The traveller here emblemed is praised by his attached friends, and exalted to a place of dignity by the ruler to whom he is acceptable. It will be seen how the idea of the fifth line being the ruler\u2019s seat is dropt here as being alien from the idea of the hexagram, so arbitrary is the interpretation of the symbolism.\nLine 6 is strong, in an even place, at the extremity of L\u00ee and of the whole hexagram. Its subject will be arrogant and violent; the opposite of what a traveller should be; and the issue will be evil. The symbolism must be allowed to be extravagant. What bird ever burned its nest? And the character for \u2018ox\u2019 is strangely used for \u2018ox-like docility.\u2019"

It symbolises both wind and wood; and has the attributes of flexibility (nearly allied to docility) and penetration. In this hexagram we are to think of it as representing wind with its penetrating power, finding its way into every corner and cranny.\nConfucius once said (Analects 12. 19):\u2014\u2018The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it.\u2019 In accordance with this, the subject of the hexagram must be understood as the influence and orders of government designed to remedy what is wrong in the people. The \u2018Daily Lecture\u2019 says that the upper trigram denotes the orders issuing from the ruler, and the lower the obedience rendered to them by the people; but this view is hardly borne out by the Text.\nBut how is it that the figure represents merely \u2018some little attainment?\u2019 This is generally explained by taking the first line of the trigram as indicating what the subject of it can do. But over the weak first line are two strong lines, so that its subject can accomplish but little. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors, rejecting this view, contend that, the idea of the whole figure being penetration, line 1, the symbol of weakness and what is bad, will not be able to offer much resistance to the subjects of the other lines, which will enter and dispel its influence. They illustrate this from processes of nature, education, and politics; the effect they say is described as small, because the process is not to revolutionise or renew, but only to correct and improve. Such as it is, however, it requires the operation of the strong and virtuous, \u2018the great man.\u2019 Even all this criticism is not entirely satisfactory.\nLine 1 is weak, where it should be strong. The movements of its subject are expressive of perplexity. He wants vigour and decision.\nLine 2 is strong, and in the right place, and has a good auspice. Things are placed or hidden beneath a couch or bed; and the subject of the line appears as searching for them. He calls in divination to assist his judgment, and exorcists to expel for him what is bad. The work is great and difficult, so that he appears almost distracted by it; but the issue is good. For this successful explanation of the line, I am indebted to the Khang-hs\u00ee editors. The writer of the Text believed of course in divination and exorcism; which was his misfortune rather than his fault or folly.\nLine 3 is in the right place for a strong line. But its position at the top of the lower trigram is supposed to indicate the restlessness, and here the vehemence, of its subject. And 6 is no proper correlate. All the striving is ineffective, and there is occasion for regret.\nLine 4 is weak, as is its correlate in 1. But 4 is a proper place for a weak line, and it rests under the shadow of the strong and central 5. Hence the omens of evil are counteracted; and a good auspice is obtained. The game caught in hunting was divided into three portions:\u2014the first for use in sacrifices; the second for the entertainment of visitors; and the third for the kitchen generally. A hunt which yielded enough for all these purposes was deemed very successful.\nOn line 5 Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze says:\u2014\u2018It is the seat of honour, and the place for the lord of Sun, from whom there issue all charges and commands. It is central and correct; we must find in its subject the qualities denoted by Sun in their greatest excellence. But those qualities are docility and accordance with what is right; and the advantage of firm correctness is insisted on. With this all will be right.\u2019 With the concluding sentence compare the conclusion of the Thwan of hexagram 18.\nThe evil that paragraph 6 concludes with would arise from the quality of Sun being carried to excess. I have followed the Kh\u01ceng-hs\u00ee editors in adopting a change of one character in the received Text."

It is a matter of some difficulty to determine in one\u2019s mind how this attribute came to be connected with the trigram. The Khang-hs\u00ee editors say:\u2014\u2018When the airs of spring begin to blow, from the collections of water on the earth the moistening vapours rise up (and descend again); so, when the breath of health is vigorous in a man\u2019s person, the hue of it is displayed in his complexion. Akin to this is the significance of the hexagram Tui representing a marsh, as denoting pleasure.\nAlthough the yin lines give it its special character they owe their power and effect to the yang; so when the qualities of mildness and harmony prevail in a man, without true-heartedness and integrity to control and direct them, they will fail to be correct, and may degenerate into what is evil. Hence it is said that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct!\u2019\nThe feeling then of pleasure is the subject of this hexagram. The above quotation sufficiently explains the concluding characters of the Thwan; but where is the intimation in Tui of progress and attainments? It is supposed to be in the one weak line surmounting each trigram and supported by the two strong lines. Fancy sees in that mildness and benignity energised by a double portion of strength.\nLine 1, strong in the place of strength, with no proper correlate above, is thus confined to itself. But its subject is sufficient for himself. There will be good fortune.\nLine 2, by the rule of place, should be weak, but it is strong.\nWithout any proper correlate, and contiguous to the weak 3, the subject of 1t might be injuriously affected, and there would be cause for repentance. But the sincerity natural in his central position counteracts all this.\nThe view of the third paragraph that appears in the translation is derived from the Khang-hs\u00ee editors. The evil threatened in it would be a consequence of the excessive devotion of its subject to pleasure.\n\u2018The bordering on what is injurious\u2019 in paragraph 4 has reference to the contiguity of line 4 to the weak 3. That might have an injurious effect; but the subject of 4 reflects and deliberates before he will yield to the seduction of pleasure, and there is cause for joy.\nThe danger to the subject of line 5 is from the weak 6 above, in whom he is represented as \u2018trusting.\u2019 Possibly his own strength and sincerity of mind may be perverted into instruments of evil; but possibly, they may operate beneficially.\nThe symbolism of paragraph 6 is akin to that of 3, though no positive auspice is expressed. The subject of line 3 attracts others round itself for the sake of pleasure; the subject of this leads them to follow himself in quest of it."

Wind moving over water seems to disperse it, and awakes naturally in the beholder the idea of dissipation.\nThe intimation of progress and success is supposed to be given by the strong lines occupying the central places. The king goes to the ancestral temple, there to meet with the spirits of his ancestors. His filial piety moves them by the sincerity of its manifestation. Those spirits come and are present. Let filial piety\u2014in our language, let sincere religion\u2014rule in men\u2019s minds, and there will be no alienation in them from what is right and good or from one another. And if the state of the country demand a great or hazardous enterprise, let it be undertaken. But whatever is done, must be done with due attention to what is right, firmly and correctly.\nLine 1, at the commencement of the hexagram, tells us that the evil has not yet made great progress, and that dealing with it will be easy. But the subject of the line is weak, and in an odd place. He cannot cope with the evil himself. He must have help, and he finds that in a strong horse, which description is understood to be symbolical of the subject of the strong second line.\nLine 2 is strong, but in an even place. That place is, indeed, the central, but the attribute of the lower trigram Khan is peril. These conditions indicate evil, and action will be dangerous; but the subject of 2 looks to 1 below him, and takes shelter in union with its subject. Since the commentary of Kh\u01ceng-\u017eze, this has been the interpretation of the line.\nLine 3 is weak, and in an odd place. A regard for himself that would unfit its subject for contributing any service to the work of the hexagram might be feared; but he discards that regard, and will do nothing to be repented of. There is a change of style in the Chinese text at this point. As Wang Sh\u01cen-\u017eze (Y\u00fcan dynasty) says:\u2014\u2018Here and henceforth the scattering is of what should be scattered, that what should not be scattered may be collected.\u2019\nLine 4, though weak, is in its correct place, and adjoins the strong 5, which is in the ruler\u2019s seat. The subject of 4, therefore, will fitly represent the minister, to whom it belongs to do a great part in remedying the evil of dispersion. And this he does. He brings dissentient partizanship to an end; and not satisfied with that, he collects multitudes of those who had been divided into a great body so that they stand out conspicuous like a hill.\nLine 5 gives us the action of the ruler himself;\u2014by his proclamations, and by his benevolence. K\u00fb Hs\u00ee and other critics enlarge on the symbolism of the perspiration, which they think much to the point. P. Regis avoids it, translating\u2014\u2018Ille, magnas leges dissipans, facit ut penetrent(ur?).\u2019 Canon McClatchie has an ingenious and original, so far as my Chinese reading goes, note upon it:\u2014\u2018As sweat cures fevers, so do proclamations cure rebellions.\u2019 Both of these translators miss the meaning of the other instance of the king\u2019s work.\nLine 6 is occupied by a strong line, which has a proper correlate in 3; but 3 is at the top of the trigram of peril. The subject of 6 hurries away from association with the subject of it, but does so in the spirit of the hexagram, so that there is no error or blame attaching to him."

How the constituent trigrams are supposed to suggest or indicate this meaning will be seen in Appendix II.\nK\u00fb Hs\u00ee anticipates that symbolism in trying to account for the statement that the figure gives the promise of success and attainment; but the ground of this is generally made out by referring to the equal division of the undivided and divided lines and our having in 2 and 5, the central places, two undivided lines.

There are two divided lines in the centre and two undivided below them and above them. The divided lines in the centre are held to represent the heart or mind free from all pre-occupation, without any consciousness of self; and the undivided lines, on each side of it, in the centre of the constituent trigrams are held to denote the solidity of the virtue of one so free from selfishness.

The ordinary view makes the other to whom the subject of line 1 looks or might look to be the subject of 4; but they contend that, excepting in the case of 3 and 6, the force of correlation should be discarded from the study of this hexagram; for the virtue of sincerity is all centred in itself, thence derived and thereby powerful.\nFor paragraph 2, see Appendix III, Section i, 42. It is in rhyme, and I have there rendered it in rhyme. The \u2018young ones of the crane\u2019 are represented by line 1. In the third and fourth sentences we have the symbolism of two men brought together by their sympathy in virtue. The subject of the paragraph is the effect of sincerity.\nThe \u2018mate\u2019 of line 3 is 6. The principle of correlation comes in. Sincerity, not left to itself, is influenced from without, and hence come the changes and uncertainty in the state and moods of the subject of the line.\nLine 4 is weak, and in its correct place. The subject of it has discarded the correlate in 1, and hastens on to the confidence of the ruler in 5, being symbolised as the moon nearly full. The other symbol of the horse whose fellow has disappeared has reference to the discarding of the subject of 1. Anciently chariots and carriages were drawn by four horses, two outsides and two insides. Lines 1 and 4 were a pair of these; but 1 disappears here from the team, and 4 goes on and joins 5.\nLine 5 is strong and central, in the ruler\u2019s place. Its subject must be the sage on the throne, whose sincerity will go forth and bind all in union with himself.\nLine 6 should be divided, but is undivided; and coming after 5, what can the subject of it do? His efforts will be ineffectual, and injurious to himself. He is symbolised by a cock\u2014literally, \u2018the plumaged voice.\u2019 But a cock is not fitted to fly high, and in attempting to do so will only suffer hurt."

		"footnote": "LXII. The name Hsi\u00e2o Kwo is explained both by reference to the lines of the hexagram, and to the meaning of the characters. The explanation from the lines appears immediately on comparing them with those of T\u00e2 Kwo, the 28th hexagram. There the first and sixth lines are divided, and between are four undivided lines; here the third and fourth lines are undivided, and outside each of them are two divided lines. The undivided or yang lines are great, the divided or yin lines are called small. In Hsi\u00e2o Kwo the divided or small lines predominate. But this peculiar structure of the figure could be of no interest to the student, if it were not for the meaning of the name, which is \u2018small excesses\u2019 or \u2018exceeding in what is small.\u2019 The author, accepted by us as king W\u01cen, had in his mind our distinction of essentials and non-essentials. Is it ever good to deviate from what is recognised as the established course of procedure? The reply is\u2014never in the matter of right; but in what is conventional and ceremonial\u2014in what is nonessential\u2014the deviation may be made, and will be productive of good. The form may be given up, but not the substance. But the thing must be done very carefully,\u2014humbly and reverently, and in small matters.\nThe symbolism of the bird is rather obscure. The whole of it is intended to teach humility. It is better for the bird to descend, keeping near to where it can perch and rest, than to hold on ascending into the homeless regions of the air.\nLine 1 is weak, in an odd place, and possessed by the \u2018idea of exceeding, which belongs to the hexagram. Its correlate is the Strong 4, belonging to the trigram K\u01cen, the attribute of which is movement. \u2018There is nothing to repress the tendency of 1; rather It is stimulated; and hence the symbolism.\nLine 2 is weak, but in its proper place, and in the centre. Its correlate is 5, which is also a weak line. The lines 3 and 4 between them are both strong; and are supposed to represent the father and grandfather of the subject of 2; but he or she goes past them, and meets with the grandmother in 5. Again, 5 is the ruler\u2019s seat. The subject of 2 moves on to him, but not as an enemy; but humbly and loyally, as his minister according to the attributes of a weak line in the central place. It must be allowed that this view of the symbolism and its interpretation is obscure and strained.\nThe subject of line 3 is too confident in his own strength, and too defiant of the weak and small enemies that seek his hurt.\nLine 4 is also strong, but the exercise of his strength by its subject is tempered by the position in an even place. He is warned, however, to continue quiet and restrain himself.\nLine 5, though in the ruler\u2019s seat, is weak, and incapable of doing anything great Its subject is called king or duke because of the ruler\u2019s seat; and the one whom in the concluding sentence he is said to capture is supposed to be the subject of 2.\nThe first part of the symbolism is the same as that of the Thwan under hexagram 9, q. v. I said there that it probably gave a testimony of the merit of the house of K\u00e2u, as deserving the throne rather than the kings of Shang. \u2018That was because the Thwan contained the sentiments of Wan, while he was yet only lord of K\u00e2u. But the symbolism here was the work of the duke of K\u00e2u, after his brother king W\u00fb had obtained the throne. How did the symbolism then occur to him? May we not conclude that at least the hsiang of this hexagram was written during the troubled period of his regency, after the accession of W\u00fb\u2019s son, king Kh\u01ceng?\nThe Khang-hs\u00ee editors find in the concluding symbolism an incentive to humility:\u2014\u2018The duke, leaving birds on the wing, is content to use his arrows against those in a cave!\u2019\nLine 6 is weak, and is at the top of the trigram of movement. He is possessed by the idea of the hexagram in an extreme degree, and is incapable of keeping himself under restraint."

The character called K\u00ee is used as a symbol of being past or completed. \u017d\u00ee denotes primarily crossing a stream, and has the secondary meaning of helping and completing. The two characters, combined, will express the successful accomplishment of whatever the writer has in his mind. In dealing with this lineal figure, king W\u01cen was thinking of the condition of the kingdom, at length at rest and quiet. The vessel of the state has been brought safely across the great and dangerous stream. The distresses of the kingdom have been relieved, and its disorders have been repressed. Does anything remain to be done still? Yes, in small things. The new government has to be consolidated. Its ruler must, without noise or clamour, go on to perfect what has been wrought, with firmness and correctness, and ever keeping in mind the instability of all human affairs. That every line of the hexagram is in its correct place, and has its proper correlate is also supposed to harmonize with the intimation of progress and success.\nLine 1, the first of the hexagram, represents the time immediately after the successful achievement of the enterprise it denotes;\u2014the time for resting and being quiet. For a season, at least, all movement should be hushed. Hence we have the symbolism of a driver trying to stop his carriage, and a fox who has wet his tail, and will not tempt the stream again.\nLine 2 is weak, and in its proper place. It also has the strong correlate 5; and might be expected to be forward to act. But it occupies its correct and central place, and suggests the symbol of a lady whose carriage has lost its screen. She will not advance further so soon after success has been achieved; but keep herself hidden and retired. Let her not try to find the screen. When it is said that she will find this \u2018after seven days,\u2019 the meaning seems to be simply this, that the period of K\u00ee \u017d\u00ee will then have been exhausted, the six lines having been gone through, and a new period, when action will be proper. shall have commenced.\nThe strong line 3, at the top of the lower trigram, suggests for its subject one undertaking a vigorous enterprise. The writer thinks of K\u00e2o \u017dung, the sacrificial title of W\u00fb Ting, one of the ablest sovereigns of the Shang dynasty (B.C. 1364-1324), who undertook an expedition against the barbarous hordes of the cold and bleak regions north of the Middle States. He is mentioned again under the next hexagram. He appears also in the Sh\u00fb, IV, ix, and in the Shih, IV, iii, ode 5. His enterprise may have been good, and successful, but it was tedious, and the paragraph concludes with a caution.\nLine 4 is weak, and has advanced into the trigram for water. Its subject will be cautious, and prepare for evil, as in the symbolism, suggested probably by the nature of the trigram.\n\u2018The neighbour in the East\u2019 is the subject of line 5, and \u2018the neighbour in the West\u2019 is the subject of the correlate 2, the former quarter being yang and the latter yin. Line 5 is strong, and 2 is weak; but weakness is more likely to be patient and cautious than strength. They are compared to two men sacrificing. The one presents valuable offerings; the other very poor ones. But the second excels in sincerity, and his small offering is the more acceptable.\nThe topmost line is weak, and on the outmost edge of Khan, the trigram of peril. His action is violent and perilous, like that one attempting to cross a ford, and being plunged overhead into the water."

		"footnote": "LXIV. Wei \u017d\u00ee is the reverse of K\u00ee \u017d\u00ee. The name tells us that the successful accomplishment of whatever the writer had in his mind had not yet been realised. The vessel of the state has not been brought across the great and dangerous stream. Some have wished that the Y\u00ee might have concluded with K\u00ee \u017d\u00ee, and the last hexagram have left us with the picture of human affairs all brought to good order. But this would not have been in harmony with the idea of the Y\u00ee, as the book of change. Again and again it has been pointed out that we find in it no idea of a perfect and abiding state. Just as the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever-recurring round, so is it with the phases of society. The reign of order has been, and has terminated; and this hexagram calls us to see the struggle for its realisation recommenced. It treats of how those engaged in that struggle should conduct themselves with a view to secure the happy consummation.\nHow the figure sets forth the state of things by its constituent trigrams will appear in Appendix II. A similar indication is supposed to be given by the lines, not one of which is in the correct place; the strong lines being all in even places, and the weak lines in odd. At the same time each of them has a proper correlate; and so the figure gives an intimation of some successful progress. See also Appendix I.\nThe symbolism of the young fox suggests a want of caution on the part of those, in the time and condition denoted by the hexagram, who try to remedy prevailing disorders. Their attempt is not successful, and they get themselves into trouble and danger. Whatever can be done must be undertaken in another way.\nI suppose a fox to be intended by the symbolism of line 1, bringing that animal on from the Thwan. Some of the commentators understand it of any animal. The line is weak, at the bottom of the trigram of peril, and responds to the strong 4, which is not in its correct place. Its subject attempts to be doing, but finds cause to regret his course.\nThe subject of line 2, strong, and in the centre, is able to repress himself, and keep back his carriage from advancing; and there is good fortune.\nThe Khang-hs\u00ee editors say that it is very difficult to understand what is said under line 3; and many critics suppose that a negative has dropt out, and that we should really read that \u2018it will not be advantageous to try and cross the great stream.\u2019\nLine 4, though strong, is in an even place; and this might vitiate the endeavours of its subject to bring about a better state of things. But he is firm and correct. He is in the fourth place moreover, and immediately above there is his ruler, represented by a weak line, humble therefore, and prepared to welcome his endeavours. Let him exert himself vigorously and long, as K\u00e2o \u017dung did in his famous expedition (see last hexagram, line 3), and he will make progress and have success. Expeditions beyond the frontiers in those days were not very remote. Intercourse was kept up between the army and the court. Rewards, distinctions, and whatever was necessary to encourage the army, were often sent to it.\nLine 5 is weak, in an odd place. But its subject is the ruler, humble and supported by the subject of the strong 2; and hence the auspice is very good.\nThe subject of line 6, when the work of the hexagram has been done, appears disposed to remain quiet in the confidence of his own power, but enjoying himself; and thereby he will do right. If, on the contrary, he will go on to exert his powers, and play with the peril of the situation, the issue will be bad."
